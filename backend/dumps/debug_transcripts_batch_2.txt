TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] right so when i write work orders i start in helix i'll just open up whatever app i'm going to start in this case it'll be this app first thing i always do is just create a folder on my local drive to store the exhibit five and any other documents that i'll need so i've just created the folder here and i've downloaded the latest version of the final so here i have this i'll open it up and see what the work is going to be actually that's a different app so here i'll just look through quickly this one we see pull thirty three four maxwell road has poull replacement here i'll check down just see how many this only has the one and i'll also check the poll size column here we see there was a thirty five and a thirty it's a thirty in the field but thirty five in gis in this case i believe i already went in and changed the size there is one other app where i will need to change the size this one just so i don't have to wait for the work order to get sent to gis i left the size i already ch that one but here i believe on another work request a size needs to be changed so i'll show how this is done we see whenever we're in gis this is we'll start out in the main alternative which is just the collection of everything as everyone sees it so if i find the gis id in the exhibit five i can copy that and then i can put it in in the navigator make sure search mode is pull paste the gis id select whatever comes up after we search and go to the poll so here actually this poll is the one i'll be changing poll sixteen peckrothers road so since it's thirty in the field i'll check make sure gis says that it's thirty five so this needs to be changed to a thirty so here's the first way we can create an alternative that's specific and different from the top we click file new project and design and when i'm making these changes we need to choose a name for the alternative here i'm going to call this work order number and i'll do it use it from the makereadyady work column and underscore edits click ok and now this will create the alternative and it should have a status of new new work when it first starts we'll get this prompt so we can't do anything when it's in new work we'll change the status change state here to proposed then click yes so now it's writable now we can make the change so i'll just this only needs to have the height changed to thirty once that's changed you'll see a delta showing that it is changed you can click update here the delta will go away and that'll show as thirty so now i'll save this at this point nobody else will see that it's shown as a thirty unless they open up this alternative so to get it post to top i'll click file change state and complete ingis and i'll click yes and now i should get a prompt saying okay a job has been submitted to process this request just click okay there and then once that's done i can close out of this and once it's posted you'll see that now it's a thirty so once i've done this i'll go into lci i'll search for the the work order here so when i bring up the poll it'll be in the invoices tab in poull data this is poll sixteen so here anyime we have to make a change to gis we'll check the gis edit required box here and that's all i need for this one so i'll close this out do you physically i'll sorry ineratic flashion you don't physically go in load the poll up and change the poll in the poll model no i don't do that i think when they create the model i believe that they'll take the field values so this is just just to show that's what the height is in jis okay appreciate it let's see on the exhibit five i will since this is now a thirty in jis and in the field i'll just change this to a thirty and delete the extra note and save this and there may be other notes for things to change and it'll be basically the same process anytime gis needs to be updated so here's the the app with the work i've already done one step for this one just to make things quicker because we have to send the the work order from storms to gis to be able to write it so what i do is i navigate to the poll and here's the poll that we're going to replace i need to find the nearest feeder so we select the primary and then feeder number is here so we need to have that then we can go into into storms open the work request now on the geographical tab we'll add this one step here that we should do first is the two seventy complete design complete requirement this one if this isn't already assigned to the work order writor this needs to be assigned to the work order writer before we send the design to gis once that is on the geographical tab and the location id what we have to enter in is the two numbers from the district and the district is shown here any on nine so we write oine and then dash and the feeder number from gis and once we do that we click design gis and then we'll just get a prompt asking us if we want to convert it to a gis design and we click yes and once that happens on the references tab you should see a check with the gis box and that will mean that it has already been sent to the gis if we don't see that then click refresh and if it doesn't come up then there's usually something wrong for example the financials tab may not have been completed or somewhere like the feeder may have started in a different district and we may have to find another feeder to get it to send but usually it sends without a problem once it is sent it can take a while but to start the work order we can go to browse designs here it takes a while to search if we don't narrow the search down usually it's enough to if the owner is set you can just put an asterisk here and type in the work request if you don't know who the owner is and you want to look something up then there's a format that it the work request gets set to by default it's zero nine which is the district whatever that is and the year it's sent twenty five and then the work request so you can search for it that way if you don't have the owner so now once we do see this it's going to start out in new work for the status we have to make sure that it doesn't have a writer if it has a writer then we can't set it to proposed or it could cause problems so we try to take ownership even though the owner is set to us because we completed the or we assign the two seventy and stormstus click take ownership and then take ownership of selected designs click yes and nothing happened so if there was a writer that it would' have given a prompt that said this says a writer so because it didn't we can now change the state to proposed then we'll get this prompt just click yes when it's ready we'll get a pop up that says it's ready all right process it is complete click ok i'll close out of this out of the design browser for now so here i'll go back to the poll i tend to like to have a picture of the poll because we're going to have to i use specific cus representing the hardware that's on the poll so i'll open the picture in lci and while i'm here i'll just assign the work requests to myself so in assignments and this is in the any work order database and lci but tools manage assignments change status i'll look for the apps in work order assigned and i'll try to find this doesn't have the comcast listed in the name it just has the name but once you find the app click set status change status to work order in progress and assign user to yourself then update assignment pose out of that go to assignment load assignment assigned to user and then work order in progress and open it and then records and poull data load selected from source load assignment and then we can get the poll picture here i'll try the preview poll images to see if it's a decent picture to see this way it's sideways so i'm going to load the poll to look at it so last you unload load polls and p the most recent one click okay i measure a load images so here i see it's just has a group primary and from the standards we just know that this is a nine eleven and you'll see what it shows in the description replace nine dash seven eleven poull top and transfer primary replace primary downuy three dash one oh five figure one transfer neutral ten one hundred figure two so if you're familiar with the standards then those are pretty easy so now we'll go in into the poll in gis now that it's proposed we can make the changes i'll select the poll and what we see is the poll as it is and we need to change it to what it's going to be so here we're replacing it with an elco set thirty five f three poll so i'll change height to thirty five i'll change class to three and those are the only changes we've made we want to make sure setby says electric sometimes it'll say telco or telephone and that'll be the other thing that we usually have to change once it's ready there's this button here and this is all in the editor tab i may not have mentioned it but this button here is to replace so we click this and now this will turn into a replaced pole it gives a prompt who is removing the old pole as long as it's jo this will always be telephone i click ok and now the anchor is also on an object like this i the anchor and the guy too so yeah first i'll select the anchor by clicking the pole until the anchor comes up so here we have the anchor and guy and here sometimes it'll call to replace the anchor but in this case it's just replace primary down guy so in the anchor and guy i'll select anchored guy wires here and then in this lower window i'll select the whichever guy wire needs to be replaced in this case the primary here the only one so i'll double click that i'll change the wire size to twelve point five mf that's for the fiberglass rod and twelve point five m that would be a twenty five if the work description had said so if that were threeash one of six or if we see in the picture that it's a double guy then need to make sure that's right the position we need to change this to more specific one this is going to be primary this is a y circuit so primary grounded y and once everything's set and it's going to be the way the new guy will be kind of like we did with a poull replacement we'll click this replace button so now we have the poull with two objects one is replace and when it has it one is the remove so click through until you see it now here where we had chosen electric for the the replaced pole this will need to be set to telephone for the remove pole once we click this we can just click update to commit the changes and this will make sure the costs go through and later on we'll do in an exchange of notice and that needs to be set right for the exchange of notice to populate correctly but so that should be good for everything that we have on the pole relatively simple poull so i'll go from editor into the point span editor now this one there's two ways to create a point we can create from selection and if we only have a secondary move and no facilities are being replaced on the pole then we can use this button and this just creates a point and doesn't add anything to it but when we're replacing the pole there's a much more convenient way that we kind of have to use so i'll delete this work point instead i'll use this one generate work records i get this prompt and i'll select create new one thing to note is you should never use rebuild in this window because if you've done a ton of design points and you click rebuild this is going to get rid of most of the cu that you've already added and if you don't catch it it can be quite a while to go back and change everything back to what it should be so here i'll click run and this is going to automatically create a design point and it's going to add certain cus to that design point but not everything that we need and they aren't always right so we should go in and check what everything is so i can see here if i start from the top the primary gives us the nine dash seven eleven cl the cl just means it's covered wire and that comes from gis i'll usually leave that as it is if it were bare then i wouldn't have the cl at the end it comes with a transfer of the primary wire we'll leave that as far as the anchor and guy goes this gives a transfer i'll delete this one because nothing's really being transferred the anchor in the field is just going to stay in place and the guy is going to be replaced so i'll delete this and here the cu makes sense we have the install of the guy wire is the guy three one o five twelve point five m ti ninety five b if this were delta we'd see it a two at the end the ti ninety five b is the insulator the fiberglass rod that gets put into the primary guise for the remove we see it's guyash down r slash t all and that means remove transfer all and that's what we'll usually use if we're removing an object the pole would be an exception for that but also if we are transferring we can see here at the primary cu has the same thing the rtl so that's good for the remove for the guy wire now the secondary it has the transfer of the wire but it doesn't have the clamp so we'll see here is where it's clamped to the pole since it's through and it's at an angle this is the tenash one hundred figure two so as long as it's less than ten degrees if it's close i think we could usually check the ocalc model so this is within ten degrees of a hundred and eighty so looks like the right model i'll add the cu i'll show in the standards book sometimes there's references to what the cu is that we're going to use go to the secondary section and ten one hundred so it's since it's one to ten degree line the figure two at the top it has a little note here it says pure one sds for secondary clamp p one ssa two for secondary clamp angle and or yeah p one ssa p one ssa two for secondary dead end angle so this cu would correspond to the greater angles this cu corresponds to the lesser angles and then just if it's serero degrees the p one sds then if it were dead end secondary we'd use a p one ssad but the way we add this is once you've opened the object and the editor that pops up go to c list our cl list right click add co and here you can have favorites added i have these added already but so i'll go to the way you navigate it normally if you don't have it added is there's all the categories under group one of the more common ones is poull hardware secondary and if you need to find primary then you can go through here if it's covered like in this case you would go primary poull hardware primary covered primary bearer for not covered but i'll choose the secondary here and if you click on co code that'll sort everything alphabetically so it'll be easier to find so here this one even though the description says secondary clamp angle eleven to sixty we'll use this one because it's what the standard books says there's really only three basic ones to remember is the pure one sds for zero p one ssa for one to ten and pure one ssa two for sixty one or over but this is the one that we have so we need to install a new one i'll click once it's selected and if you did want to add it to your favorites you can just right click add to favorites and then it'll go but be careful what you add because it's easy to add something but it doesn't seem to get removed but so wherever we are in this window we just find the cus if i go to design on this tab anything that's already in the design on another poll you can just grab from here and that can be convenient if there's a lot of polls on the same work order but so once i know the cu that i'm going to add i'm going to click apply and i'll select install and click okay and this also needs a remove and in this case i'm going to click okay and select the remove and i'll click okay and because i clicked i selected okay instead of apply that closes the window so i usually just use apply when i want to to add multiple cus to the same object and then the last one i use okay so now the secondary is okay the primary and the guy is okay for the poll we see that the install is the thirty five three that's good sometimes it'll come up thirty five three jo and that means that telephone is going to be doing the work so we need to make sure that's changed it's okay in this case so i'll double click the poll and on c list i'll right click and add c and there's certain standard cus that we add to every poll one is pla same hole then a labor unit for numbering the polls a wood reflector and a poll tag that says ng and these four cus are the same for all polls we also need to add stencils for the number so i'll go to all cus i'll change the group to poll hardware miscellaneous i'll sort this alphabetically i usually click it twice i believe to get the when we start seeing the tags and let's just scroll down a little bit and then you can see the numbers so here we're going to add two threes for the thirty three dash four so there's two ways you can change the quantity one you can add it here now when i add the cu and quantity two is selected i can then see that two get added it changes fact to one and then now it needs the dash that's just below the numbers and the four and that's the last one so i'll click okay so now we see we have the all the cus that we're going need for the poll installation if i were to say take any of these if i needed another four or something here i could click two and then click update and that's another way to change the quantity of the cus change that back to one right so and the final thing we have to do is the poll removal so this is kind of a different cu this isn't likely the one that we're going use because it doesn't have a jo so it won't do the proper billing or populate the paperwork correctly i'll sort by co code then i'll look down for the pw thirty here in this case we can see it't if it is going to be removed by telco then it has to have the class five it's the remove is a little bit less important than the install we want it to be accurate if we can get it but this looks like there's no way for us to get a thirty class four so in this case i'm going to have to change it to a thirty class five and so now i've replaced it with the thirty class five and you can see in the fields certain cus when you change them it'll update the fields here and that change to to the class five so when you choose cus be careful and just be aware that some of them will change the properties but we also have to add one more if it gets because i clicked away it's grayed out so i'll just go back into the poll here open it again right click add c and i have in the favorites it's the cuto top pla cuto top i'll apply the first time that you find the cus you can either look under labor adders and here's a whole bunch of whole labor adders to choose from i don't believe this is a rear lot but sometimes we'll have rear lot and in that case we'll have to add something like here the rear lot adder for a poll replacement but here's where you would find the cuto top and another way to find a cu is you see i have i like to keep a list just a simple notepad file say like if we're extending risers there's a whole bunch of cus so it's sometimes easier i can copy from here and then under code i paste first while there's still a group if you uncheck the group and there's nothing to filter it by it'll try to load all the cus in the catalog and that takes a bit so i'll paste the cu i'll uncheck group and now i can just select the cu that way so that's another convenient way to find the cu that you need but this is all done we have all the cus now one more step which i like to do after all the design points have been added and in this case they have because it's the only design point in the app but on the exhibit five we need to check the built applicant list and if this says yes then we need to set the cus to added service if this says no then we need to set them to system improvement and sometimes it'll be mixed and we just have to set the cus individually usually that's if there's guying work that's billable to national grid and the rest of the poll is filled to the applicant there's a few ways of setting the cus to the added service this one up here at the top of the point span editor sets all of them for the entire work request and this is the most convenient because when there's a lot of points they're usually mostly billable so we don't want to be going in and setting each point individually and we can also set it to system improvement there's also standard cost but we should never leave anything as standard cost and if you see when a cu first gets added you can right click on it and it'll show what the costs are so i'm just going to set everything to added service then just gives you the number of cus that were' set i'm going to click okay if i wanted to set say all the cus for the poll to something then i can right click on it and then set everything from there oftentimes this would be the anchor if the guying work were non billable we'd set to system improvement if there is individual cus say we needed something on the poll that needed to be set then you can just select the individual cu and change it to what it needs to be so this is basically everything we need to do for the poll i'll save here i like to save every time i complete a worko and i'll click yes sometimes something may get messed up accidentally while you're working on a worko and it's very convenient to be able to undo all the changes since the last save that's oftentimes much easier than trying to move things back to where they were and we only get so many undoos and some things don't seem to work right when we use the undo button but here we have just the design point the only one on the work request so we're ready for the construction sketch one thing i do when i'm ready for the construction sketch on polls is i'll add an annotation automatically by selecting the poull replace and then in the editor tab we have u specials add work order annotation so this usually comes up with the size and class of the poll and then the primary hardware that's installed and if there's any anchor installation or guy installation that should show up as well and we also add one for the remove so the remove here shows the poll that's being removed and we want to look for this part removed by telco it's just kind of an easy way to double check that we have it set correctly i'll move it a little bit away from the poll number annotation so i'll click the this button here show insertion points and this just gives little squares to show what you need to select in order to move the annotations or other objects so i'll se once it's selected click this button here this is move by dragging sometimes we'll want to also rotate objects so we can select rotate by dragging so i'll move this up just a little bit closer to the the annotation it seems to be working now i hope it isn't frozen but we'll see i guess using thele click middle button to pan seem to have stopped that i'll try this one more time all right that worked i'll just move this still a little bit up to the side try to keep everything nicely in the white space so it's basically ready for the construction sketch so now i'm going to create the construction sketch's see we have to go to the plotting tab and first i'll set a trail point i kind of like to use the right click button if you clear trail this guarantees that there's no other trail points and it also if you're in select mode it also brings you into the trail mode so it's pretty convenient to just get into trail mode this way i'll put a point where the sketch is going to be centered so i'll just put it on the poll for now and we can always move the sketch after but so under plotting plot applications construction plots i'll click add so now the plot name came up with the page that we just added i like to remove the one through ten if you want you can change this to the number of sketches that there are but it isn't really needed and that can change sometimes and if you save the file it'll save with the name of whatever this is and if the name has to be changed then we can't delete what's saved so we have to go to the helpdesk to ask them to delete the files so it's easier to just delete this and if you need more plots then you can start numbering them one through however many usually just one or two but this is the only one so i'm just going to delete that and i'm going click update now while i'm here this is a bunch of fields that are going get populated automatically in the title block of the construction sketch so i'm going just fill in some of these so that i don't have to later i'll select the primary to get the feeder number double click on the plot again to get back to this window enter the feeder update i'll try to click through to get the to get the town so we have munonson we'll remember that and the boundary code here this is what we should change the taxt id to so the taxt district or town code gets that four digit number update i'll copy the app name from helix and i'll set this as the job title and for notes we have to click this box to edit it i'll put the town and state so here munson mass and i'll also put just a very brief description of what kind of work is on the poll is it just one poll replacement so now that's set on the first page for any plot it'll get automatically set with a size that isn't that just fills the window and this shows up in viewcale so the first time double click the page and change this to fifty and i always do the style fifty so should say display style one to fifty and viewcale fifty i'll click okay and then if i were to add another one you can see the next time it would come up as fifty and then each one from there on will be the same but if you' i don't want this one so what i will do i'll click delete but and that is the button there when we do need the second one set the trailo and use this button here construct frames from trail and if you use this button or this that's going to add an entirely new plot and that's only if you have ten or more or if you have more than ten pages then you should use that method but i'm going to zoom out a little bit and i'll try to find the convenient place to put this i guess in this case we could get both adjacent pollls and we see the street that it's off of so this will be a convenient location maybe i'll move it over to the right a little bit to get some white space to put the put other boxes into one last step before i actually edit it is i'm going to to show an area map i will change plot type to index map electric and then when we have a bigger area they aren't going to see the street names so here i'll select something usually four hundred sometimes rarely if it's really big i might choose a thousand but when you choose the number here you can then click this create the index so gets created small so i'll select it here and then i can make it bigger but i'll zoom out a little bit and here we want to make sure we have some kind of cross streets and this is out quite far away from everything so i'll have to make it fairly big you can't get it you can always click off click back again usually it should show the points i guess it isn't in this case i'll see if this is a good area i'll select the top one here click generate maps we'll get two prompts anytime we do this usually just click ok through each of them i'll click review i'm going to change the the objects that are showing it's a little bit easier to read the index if we turn the electric objects off so in this display style window or drop down i'll change this to the whatever size the map that i want to change is and in object control i'll just check js to uncheck it and then see how this looks drag over to refresh so here we can see we have the two cross streets this should be good silver street and then howley road since this is good i'll start working on the sketch for every sheet i'll add a north arrow using this button just click it and then click and drag to set the size i try to keep this in the top left seem to work that time okay so there i have the north arrow if it isn't in white space then i'll fill the background and i always like to add an outline so the fill color for the fill will be white and then the outline foreground color will be black just click on another box so it actually sets and then i'll close out of this i'm going to do the same thing on page one so i'll just do that right now this one i'll just change the outline since there's nothing that'll be changing the view nothing behind it so one thing we always add is a note with our name and contact information i'll select the text box option here and i put this at the bottom right other work order writers may do this slightly differently but's generally quite similar for the text size i'll change this to four and for horizontal alignment i change this to left vertical alignment top and just typically there's something behind this in this case there isn't but i'm going to use this to copy onto the next page just so i don't have to keep repeating all of the steps of setting up the text box so i'm going to change the outline to black the fill color to white and for now i'm going to close out of this i'm just going to right click copy and then on page one i'm going to right click paste and then i can use this for whatever i need to later just now i have the note that i always put ready to copy and paste into it so i'm just going going grab that and i'll paste this into text it only has one line if we're just writing like a street annotation then we can enter that there but this is multi line so i'll click this window and overwrite what's in it so then i'll click ok this is usually designed by name osmos phone number and email and i'll just resize this to something that looks decent and just put it in the corner once this is done i'll save here it's good to save often because if you accidentally close out everything you've done will be undone so i'm going to save here when it saves usually jumps to the last page and i'll save the work request too so this text box is going to be a description for the work on the poll i'm going to start by writing what poll it is so this is p thirty three four and i can get the street name maxwell road and then in parentheses i put li space and then whatever the root code is sometimes it's on the exhibit five if not then i go into the poll editor and this is the line number root code so it's the zero one two four and usually that'll also show in the street i'll copy that and so if you click a street you can see the zero one two four and then the zero four one two is the town code on the next line i would usually add police protection but in this case the poll isn't really on our road it's just in somebody's driveway essentially not sure if you can tell from the from here i one way i'll check if it's questionable is i'll go to the mass road inventory site can just google mass massachusetts road inventory or you know this should be a link somewhere i can i'll paste the links afterwards but click ok with the pop up need an address to search to all to navigate to find a nearby service if you select the service youit the service point you can choose a premise usually you'll have the house number but in this case it you can also try opening it and then clicking special css data and here it has this street number so ninety seven maxwell road we'll need that later on for some documents too and here we can see that there is no actual road it's just the driveway so i'm going not going to add any police protection for this one and i'll add whatever the description of work is sometimes there will be extra notes like if we see a note that the surveyor mentioned something or that there's equipment on the poll then i'll leave that part out just has to be determined on a case by case basis i'll copy that and paste it in the description i'll click ok i'll just click off of it to make sure it sets then close that and resize it so that it looks good and i'll place this near the poll somewhere seems fine over to the side i'll add one of these the mgrid legend and this will just say what object is what and standard for every sheet should have one of those i'll also add annotations for the road and cross streets if there's work on the road then i'll add the line so here i'll add it pretty much as as it shows up when it there is an annotation so like this the maxwell road so maxwell road zero one two four add this in a text box and size for if the road's showing i'll try to edit into the whitepace of the road now there's going to be cross streets on each side so the one toward the west is silver street i'll add the text box we'll also add one for the other cross street this is huby road and since they're the cross streets and they're not on the sketch i'll just point an arrow to the direction that they are so i go into trail mode and put create two trailos and i'll click this arrow button leader line do the same for this so i also need to add a feeder number annotation this one we can add automatically from the primary i'll put a design point next to the primary and i'll select the primary and and under feeder number annotation i'll select it and click this button to insert it then i will a little bit below it put another trailo and click the line voltage anal and then i'll click update and i'll just change this to horizontal one always comes horizontal and another one parallel with the primary then that's almost it there's just one more thing is in this case because the cross streets are so far away i will add a gps coordinates at the bottom so i'll go back into the the annotation and i'll say gps i'll take this from lci copy that long to clipboard i'll just set this so it's only six digits long or six decimal points i'll click okay all right so here's the basic basics of what we put on the sketch always the north arrow the legend the description of work this will have it'll show up on the final sketch kind of various ways we just have to make sure that it looks okay when we do print the pdf but yep so north arrow legend descriptions of work street names and feeder number and any kind of annotation if there's poull replacements and occasionally we'll need an extra note if it's an antenna then we have to add a note for that for example if there's streetlights on the index if they're owned by the municipality then i would add another box just to say who owns the streetlight and we have to give their contact information but we should be done with the sketch now so i'll click save and i will close out of it now the other thing we also just want to make sure that the title block populated correctly and you can see as the test district time code is a four digit one the feeder number and just everything we've put in shows up here so i'll go back into the main gis i'm going to save and to prepare for printing the pdf i just want to make sure the right layers are showing usually i'll here if i have changed anything i'll kind of click default settings and this changes everything back to the default settings for all all display styles so i'll click that here i toggle workpo visibility they don't want the workos to be showing and also there's if you can see there's overlapping workest boxes and they don't want those showing so these two will turn those off so that makes it cleaner if there's any kind of like say anvironmentally contaminated site that's in the way of the sketch i'll turn this off but i don't see anything so i'll make sure it's fifty this is hundred might be slightly different so this is what it'll look like then the four hundred for the sketch i'll just turn the gis objects off again and refresh to see that it's there so now that i have it the way that i want it to be printed i'm going to go back to plotting i'm going to select the top level here the work request and then i'm going to click this button once this is saved it as i explained before whatever this name is is going to be the name of the pdf and we can't if we do change it then we just have to make sure we send the request for the helpdesk to delete the file so try to make sure that this is right before you click save and usually if it isn't wrong i might just leave it and submit it as is but try to remember to get that then when it so i'll save construction plot is pdf and it'll have these two windows when it's working and then should give an okay message when it's done i believe let's say just disappear yeah they probably just disappear there but i can check that it's completed correctly by clicking file browse designs and it's under construction plot pdf here if it doesn't show up then you might already have this open and you just click again to refresh it but here's the file that was just printed i'll double click this and then i'll see what it looks like at this point i kind of like to go through the exhibit five and just make sure that everything makes sense just quickly look through every point that has work on it and just make sure it's the right description with the right poull name so thirty three dash four maxwell road and this work says p thirty three d four maxwell road and has this work doesn't need the police protection so just after a quick look over if i think it's good then i'll save this to the national grid onedrive so i'll click save as navigate to a folder for the work request i haven't created one yet so i'll just click make sure this is the onedrive right click new folder and i'll copy the work request from this and rename the folder and i'll save it in here so for now what i' it's basically done in gis but i do want to send an estimate to storms and i do this before i actually set the design to design complete because this way i can go in and check that the jo paperwork is populating correctly so i'm going to send us submit to storms this may take a little bit to populate so i'm going to start now i have to do documents for the poullet so usually if you need a file it's going to be under work order resources and if you don't have this link i think i can copy it into the chat and i just noticed that all the questions were there i'll try to get to those after so in the dig safes we it's of the file one of the documents we have to do anytime there's any digging dig safes we also need an environmental checklist and various documents but i'll start with the digs safes we go nooe town by town this one this will just give us information about what we need to do so we see for munonson we'll find maybe in west should be one of these three for massachusetts so this is a digsafe member and on the water section it says that and sewer says subscribes to digsafe if it subscribes to digsafe we shouldn't need to do a notice of excavation so but we should keep in mind that there's these two forms digsafe and noe i'm going to copy both of these actually this one we't since we determined that we don't need the nooe form i'm just going to copy the digsafe actually and then i'm going to paste these into the folder that i created locally i'm going to change this to ds underscore the work request so it has this note i want to copy this note for this because it has a note i'll just click check digafe for here this is kind of on a case by case basis just have to figure out from whatever the form tells us but i'm going to say try to copy that's too big so i'll just say c above and then here this is where i'm going to put the work but i will toward the bottom of this add the note that they say so i have that note now certain things that we need to enter i'll just go through this kind of quickly because there are a few other documents that we're going that are needed or request number can get from helix the department performing work we get from storms and this is always on the general tab the crew headquarters so i'll copy this i'll paste it into here stateus mass county we can also get from storms this is hampton latitude longitude can get from lci same way that i did before municipality it's munsonon address ninety seven maxwell road that we found before we i'll just double check hit maxwell road cross streets p it up in that construction sketch i can either open it and andgis again or at this point i have a link to the to my onedrive i'll just download it to my local copy or to my local computer here so open the file select it download and that'll go into the into the downloads i'll just cut this and navigate to the local copy paste so here cross streets i guess what i will do in this case they're kind of far it isn't clear which is closest but i like to put the closest cross street first just for convenience then the distance that we say that it's from we'll determine which street comes first so this looks like it's probably a little closer to to huby road so i'll start measuring from the road i'll just measure distance and then just start putting points so this looks like it's about three thousand three hundred and fifty i'm just going to keep that in mind i'm going to put the hy road here enter the other cross street silver street method of pre mark this is always painted unless we're installing an anchor or replacing the anchor if it's an anchor we check staked but yeah painted for pole replacements or ground rod replacements always simple for this part type of pre mark and check if simple prem marks need to be initially applied during site precheck if your name here and phone number so here we just say what is being done replace the three four maxwell road and here is where i want the distance from the cross street i'm going to say three thousand three hundred and fifty feet southwest of hy road and because it's off of the road i'm also going to do one more measurement from the road so i'm going to go'm going to clear the measurement and i'll measure distance and get an idea of where it is to the road so two hundred and fifty feet say two hundred and fifty feet of maxwell road the nearest house address we found was ninety seven and here the maximum buffer distance from the center of the road we just saw that from maxwell road where we gave the description it was two hundred and fifty feet so i'll just save five hundred and then that's it for the dig safe i think i should go and just check the questions because i let's see all right do we normally have to put in a cu for a police flagging or just a note so in this i know in new york it's different i believe they use police flagging but in new england it's we would say police protection required is the note and later on there's going to be a field where we would get a calculation of the total hours from storms and we'd add that to a remark so i'll cover that when we get there so for the question needing flaggers it's like that it's kind of a gray area but i this is since it's off the road i think it's we wouldn't really need it in this case it's anytime it's on road even it's if it's just a side street if we can tell i think then just get an idea from this site see this says the jurisdiction is city or town accepted road i don't if it's a private road then i don't think we would but i would say the majority of cases we do want flaggers or we do want the police protection oh and i see that was answered there and for the saving to the local drive i do want to i do like to make sure everything is saved eventually just with the new system we're going to have to navigate the one drive and which can be a pain because sometimes it's not available but i'll just yeah show each of those as we go on so all right i'll move on to the next step so we've done the dig safe i'll do the environmental checklist next so in the work order resources you can find this under environmental and should be this one form environmental review for all projects in massachusetts i'll copy this i'll just make sure this is the right file some of them look similar okay so this is the right file i'll rename this emv check the capital c underscore then the work request number actually just leave out that part right enter the work request number here that i multiple places to copy it from project name i will copy the app name from helix location i just put the town this is munson it's all in massachusetts so i'll just say munson my name whoever is filling it out put their name that tab doesn't work no okay so the date i will put today's date estimated start date i put three months out so two five twenty five twenty six the scope of project here just put a quick list of the number of poar replacements ground rods and anchors that we'll be replacing or installing just so here's just one pole replacement then we'll go through each question here are any bodies of water indications of wetlands or floodplains located within one hundred feet of the proposed work or is a river or stream located within two hundred feet of the proposed work i'll click the link to check the fema site so i think i checked this one before so here when we go here usually there'll be information if we see that everything looks like this where it just has the green dots then that means that we'll have to find where it is and we download an image and just have to find it from the pdfs that we get but you can see that it is loaded because you're seeing some flood zones and so there clearly is no flood zones here for the wetland maps we check on this site i'm not sure if you can hear me but are you able to send us the links to these websites or is there a place for us to find it i'll send the links this particular one is you just click on the on this from there that makes sense okay sorry i didn't do that there thank you so let's see try to find the pole and that's not quite bringing me exactly there but it's around this area you can see this house there it's right there right that's the house so it's right around here and there's you can see you can use a measuring tool click length it's about there and if i were to measure this distance right there that's five hundred and fifteen feet so we're only worried about two hundred feet away so there's no way there's anything that we need to worry about here so i'll close this out so this is no if we had checked yes to anything then we would always say it's not in an emergency it says like if yes answer these questions not an emergency usually almost always it won't require construction mats almost always we're not going to have to do dewatering activities we were if the pole were say set in the swamp or something we might want to look into that if there's vegetation management this is kind of a gray area if there's several poles on an app with tree trimming i might call that extensive but if there's just say a little bit of tree trimming say one pole then i wouldn't unless it looks like it might be heavy trimming so i just a kind of a judgment call and then we check if there's any bylaw requirements or anything there's just a spreadsheet that you can open and find those i believe it's this one that's not opening then here we would just say if this were by the water i'd search for munsen and here it does say there there's bylaws at least a stormwater byo law so i would copy this into the notes at the bottom but i will leave that blank in this case i do need to check for any kind of rare species in the area and that's just simply clicking this guess there's a new site open and map here so this is the area of the pool if we zoom out we can see what it would look like if there were endangered species and i'm not seeing the layer showing i oh unable to add layer so that's a little bit difficult one i don't usually see that it's a yellow a box with yellow lines through it if it is i'll try the old site so i guess this is not going to be able to be answered right now that doesn't usually happen i'm going to leave this blank and just i'll revisit it later see if it's back up but i did check that one like in this case since i did i just kind of reviewed this work order to try to make sure no problems we're going to hold it up so that is definitely a no in this case i'll just check it in now but i will go back and try to see if that's working afterwards there's also the a site to check for any spills and it's here i believe there's a way you can navigate it to it all right it's going to be the waste site reportable loo releases that doesn't seem to be working i will i think i have it bookmarked anyway actually this yes this will be an easier link to use so we enter the town and i just enter the street name here it's going to be maxwell road so there's nothing on maxwell road so we don't have to worry about this if we did see anything then it's going to come up usually as either rtn closed status or some other status that shows that it's that there is a spill try maybe road that might have it see so say when stuff comes up click through whatever might be through each one we just check if it mostly they'll say closed so if we see the blue dot then we know that it's not something we have to worry about so nothing in this case we have to check for any cultural information here so is the project within any nationally registered or local historic districts or in the vicinity of nationally registered properties or landmarks etc just accept the terms here enter the address now this looks like it's outside of this if it're right on the line the poll is right about here if we're much closer i might say that it's in this one in this case it's not inside it but if it were i would check yes and in the notes i would say that it's in the historic district silver street area and say that it's the id mns b but that's basically if there's a dot nearby to we'll want to check those maybe next to aistorhouse or something like this and we check that so this is a no this question will any structural materials potentially containing asbestos lead paint or pcbs we have to do this if there's any asbestos riser or if we're replacing a transformer that's set date is nineteen seventy nine or before because they can potentially have pcbs but we don't have any of those so i'm going to check no so we are this is a question about wells we don't have to worry about this it says well the proposed installation of treated wood pols take place within fifty feet of a known shallow drinking water well so if it's just an anchor or a ground rod then it's always a no but if there's treated pols like this in our case we're going to have to check for any wells any shallow wells so to do that we go into ngrid gis public data file open environmental shallow wells select the cfg file click open and then select it click data set open and we can close this and you should see a layer here that says environmental shallow well again i can see that there's nothing here as long as it's checked that they should be showing if there is it's pretty rare that it's going to be near the pole but you'll see it as one of these just a circle in a circle so this one is no and for this one will any treated wood be stored and we're not doing work requests that are big enough to need to store poles that's usually if they're doing a recconductoring project or something like that so'll check no for that one usually we're not going to be doing work on substations or electric transmission lines if it's subt it might possibly be an issue but then i'm just going to click no here is if we do have something that may fit that category we're not going to be disturbing more than one acre and we're not going to be doing anything with combustion units and we won't be using more than one thousand three hundred twenty gallons of oil and also we're not going to be using ten thousand pounds of oil or hazardous material so the number eight is always no and then since we clicked no to this we don't have to click no to the rest of them so here this is where i would put any notes if there were wetlands or anything i would just put months in poll in and then i would copy the the bylaw information and then beneath that i would say just any notes of what poll is in the in the area of the wetland that needs to be checked and what the work is so i would say for example if it were three four so that's kind of an example of a note but just something simple since there's nothing don't have to put anything so i can save this and i done with the environmental checklist another thing we might do is replace polls where there's customers affected say for example if we were working on a poll with the transformer we would want to run a directional trace so national grid electric directional trace and depending on what kind of trace you want to run if we can do a downstream trace from the secondary for example and see what customers are downstream if we were say replacing a secondary span or something we wouldn't need to do this the general rule is if there's no commercial customers downstream we don't need a checklist so we when we see the list coming up we see here res com if that's c then we need it if it's r then we don't need it unless there's a case where it's like say a line cutout or something is being replaced although i think that may have changed but there's i believe in the work request the work order process document the different situations are spelt out we can also run a between trace on the transformer here so you put one point on each side of the transformer on the make sure it's snapped to the primary click between and run then here we see all of these are residential so this wouldn't need it if anything were c then i would just guess the way we do it now is i would save these select them click save and i would save it into the folder this is to get the first one so i would say three d four just have something then i would go into the onedrive and download it the first that's only for the first one where we need to save the list i would copy this and that allows us to have all of the top row so says what's what then if there were another poll you can do just whatever you need to copy just do a control c with whatever selected and then paste that and it'll just get everything copied over and i would just say like here p save this thirty three four just have a label for each poll with commercial outages but not necessary in this case that's just how you would do it if there were any so let's see then the environmental checklist dig safe didn't need a notice of excavation so i'll see if the six o five or exchange a notice is ready and storms if we go to design specification we should be able to see the all the cus that we sent so they're here we can also go view list see everything if we here's a way to have a quick overview of what capital so here for a supply method everything's yes so we know we have it set on the added service and this should match the buill to applicant list on the exhibit five that's okay so here to get the the exchange a notice we go file properties reports and i will check exchangeer notice page two and telco page two just to make sure these came through page one is just a general page where we'll put a sketch and page two is where everything gets populated so this is the new poll this is the proposed side and this is the electric one we have the thirty five three it comes default with twelve forty for per poll but since the applicant's paying we're going to have to delete that now we can see that it came through page two i'll modify this too just make sure the remove poll came through right so we see on the remove side this is the thirty five as we put it so that's okay so i'm going to save all i'm going to print all of these actually so i'll select which one i want to print hit the print button and sometimes it may come up on a printer that isn't the right one but it should always be microsoft print to pdf click ok and then locate the file in oneedrive or the file location so here's a work request so i'm going to just give it a quick name eon and this is the electric so i go e and one is it's page one i don'll repeat this for page two leave out the asb that's just for as built that's after anything we do this is two this is the telephone page one so i'm going to name this one t two or t one this one t two go into oneedrive they should all be there i'll navigate out all right so here they're all there so i'm going to select each one to click download and this will put it in a zip file i'll just open the zip file copy it into the work order folder and i'll delete the zip file i'll open each one of these so here on the page one i'll need to add a sketch and a few lines for the sketch i'll usually kind of zoom out a little bit i can put maybe put a point to show where the pole is zoom around perhaps usually where i can see some kind of a cross street it's difficult when it's the cross streets are this far away but i usually try put size two hundred and in object control i'll basically clear everything but the roads and we can't really read the road names so i'll also just turn the electric road annotation off refresh and we will have to close out in the work request i'll go back into this after so now i'll just print do a print screen and get kind of a general area around it go back to the poll and see from here this is the pole in paint i have just a quick template that i use just to get copy something to show a pole but i'll paste the print screen and select an area just a little around the pole i'll use the small one if it's this zoom this far out copy and i'll paste and it's pasting over everything so i'll make it a transparent selection and then try to match where it is doesn't have to be exact but share the general area it's about here i think that should be close enough just and then i'll add a few labels p thirty three four maxwell street or maxwell road i leave maxwell road this one i believe huby road have your road i could also do the other cross street it's the silver road i believe it's should be okay if we have one i just usually do two copy this and then on the sketch area i'll right click edit this pdf put it just in the area so they just have some kind of sketch for the voltage this comes from the primary and the editor the seven point six two kv copy an existing box usually this one i'll just to keep them at the same height i'll put a space then enter this is the other two are going to need two lines seven point six two volts copy this drag it over the reason for work we're almost always going to do third party clearance and the second line is going to be the app name and enter your name and phone number here so this is that's it for the page one that you can tell which one it is this is electric because it doesn't say telephone work there's another copy of this and it just says request for telephone company work and this needs to be the same thing so i'll right click and edit this and everything i added and also you'll notice this has a one for notice of intent to replace jo pols if there's any anchors that are jo that'll also show up there so we need to make sure those are copied the sketches copied and the three text boxes that we added are copied so control c and then crol v to paste them if it doesn't show up in the right spot you can just drag it over a little bit and that's good for elco page one and telco page one so as i mentioned before this comes up with the twelve forty anyime fillable to applicant is yes that needs to be deleted this if built to applicant is no then that doesn't need to be deleted we leave it on so here i'll just usually put three spaces in a zero to center it and the last page is usually good if there's multiple streets then i just like to make sure they're all in the same order for each page they kind of come up in random orders usually but other than that that's all we need to do so i'll save each of these and in tools we can combine these combine files and add open files add files make sure they're ordered correctly this says e one e one e two t one t two combine and this gives us one file and we just have to save this and name it and this for the exchange notice we just name it the the work request number and that's all we'll close these out there is another part the fa spreadsheet i usually use google earth to search just for nearby airports it's pretty rare that we need to have one i'll navigate to the poll copy a file of the copy the fa spreadsheet i'll rename this faa spreadsheet underscore the work request name the number enter designer name work order number project description i'll copy from helips just in parentheses third party feeder h from gis enter street name enter the poll number existing poll size i think this is really a thirty five four we have to put the other one thirty class four so this is the new poll and the old poll actually now this is i get that wrong existing poll and thirty five three all right this poll number right this is your poll number existing poll size new pole size so we know the poll is around here so i'm going to use the measuring tool and i'm just going to put one point where the poll is and then i'll search airports and these are all public airports so they should show up on a search we're not really worried about little private airports you see there's nothing really close fits ten thousand feet or more then there's never going to be a situation where we would need to complete one and if it is closer then the situation may require one but if it were say in this area here and there's buildings if there's anything around the same size of the pole or taller then we would consider it sheltered so even if something over here were near the airport we most likely wouldn't need to if you want to see the specifics of that i believe there is a document that faa memo draft two so here's the specifics of what needs when it'll need to be submitted if it's located within twenty thousand feet of a public or military airport that has a runway longer than three thousand two hundred feet with a height exceeding a slope of ten feet horizontal to one foot vertical so we just divide the distance by one hundred if it's that kind of airport if it's a shorter than three thousand two hundred feet and it's public or military then we would divide it by fifty instead so i guess if it's say like two thousand five hundred feet we divide that by fifty that's fifty so as long as we're not going above fifty feet and it's at least two thousand five hundred feet away from any airport then we won't need one and i believe it's five thousand feet or further if it's greater than three thousand two hundred feet so very rare that we will need to submit a request this case it doesn't need one so i'm just going to say a comment does not exceed notice criteria we're not submitting it so i'm going to put na for this for date accepted na for date determined this is nrid verizon so i'm going to say nrid easy and it's elcoo set i'm also going to put for the asn number na and this is a local copy i'll save this we'll attach that to storms when it's ready to submit sometimes we'll need highway permits i guess we already checked this one so just to show how we would know that it needed one is if it were on say this road for example they'll show in green and then you can click and it says that it's in the jurisdiction of the massachusetts department of transportation i don't think i copied this into the chat so so now i've done the documents and because it's usually the exchange and notice that gives an indication that it needs to be that something may need to be changed in the work request once that's done i'll usually go back into the work request and now we have it in proposed if it giv us new conflicting data just click okay then right click file refresh design continue and unlikely that we'll have conflicts here but if it says conflict not handled then that's an issue where somebody at osmos will have to resolve it that has permissions to do those i don't have that alica does i think an uppto too but it says process complete so there's no conflict so that's good we've done everything i'm just going to go file change state design complete now we want to try to minimize the times that we do this because say if we have to go and revise the exchange a notice it has a revision number and that starts to get high and it doesn't look good if we keep making changes but we've already done the exchange a notice so here i'll do design complete and i'll click yes so when it's ready i think we'll get a message that it was submitted right so this pop up comes up and says it's been sent to storms and we see that it closed out a bit so this should be all set for the jis part another part that we're going to have to do is the billing so i le on the the work order resources i usually keep my own local copy but there's a file fillable cost calculator this might not be the most recent one work management calculator so i'm pretty sure this is the most recent one you can for now i'll just copy this if you copy this should probably keep it in a general local folder but i'll copy it into to this work folder and i try not since we have to edit this one i don't want to directly open it from the work order resources because if you accidentally save it i'll save it for everyone but we don't actually have to save a copy of this we just use it to get the total that the applicant is going to be buildilled the part we're concerned with is massachusetts here so we need to make sure all of this is filled out we know that for here we have poull replacements one we didn't have any other makereadyady so that's zero fulloading analysis we have to get from lci so we'll go into the app and lci i have this open in assignment so in poll data i'll scroll over make sure this is invoices scroll over to the field loading requirements this only has two if there's anything other than none usually we that's going to count as a pla if there's a lot then you can sort by this and just do a right click control c or yes select i don't know if you can right click and control c just or copy just do control c if you use notepad plus plus oh just give the numbers so if you have like thirty or so rather than counting you can just copy them and see what row it's on think again if you use notepad instead you can just click on the last row and it'll tell you which row so it's a quick way of counting but so here we only have two and the prearks are going to be one for every poll that has any kind of digging and this should correspond to the number of polls on the digafe this is one in this case and if we have to do any redesign we add that here we don't need the police protection in this case if there were police protection though we go into storms and under the reports file report properties reports the bce the commodifys where we would take this from there's several several entries for the labor but we want to make sure we're using the total labor and since this is for what's spilled to the applicant we're just going to take the added service column and this would be twenty three point two five we should always put it as a minimum eight hours i'll round up it's twenty three point two five i i would do twenty four here if this were and then if it were less than eight hours i would put eight hours but this is zero in this case and we determine it doesn't need a highway permit if it did need one then we would submit a request you'll need to have a link that maybe need to be sent to you but those cases i think i have it somewhere i thought that would have brought me to place to submit it but i guess that's not the case all right so i click again i guess once i'm logged in so the first time we would submit it we would enter navigate to this page enter the work request number application name permit type is always going to be mass dot and we need to add three files here the exhibit five the construction sketch and this file here that you can get in work order resourources highway permits mass and this one we would copy locally just enter the app name and just fill out all these the work request number app name town the description of all the polls would work and then each poll listed individually and the construction sketch sheet that it's on and that can be found on the construction sketch at the in the title block it'll say which sheet and the coordinates and then so that's how you would submit that then whoever is going to be handling the permit would enter the information should say in this spreadsheet hours bill and estimated rate for dot fee and you would just populate those fields from there but in this case we just have the poulle replacement the two plas the one pre mark that's filled out so what i'll do is i'll create a text file i'll copy everything into this i'll just name it the work request number underscore notes usually i will just for a reminder in case i get asked about where the numbers came from i'll just put a quick description of the notes i'll copy here please charge the applicant the additional following costs and then just copy each of these lines and i will copy this note on here it says add as a tpg remark in the storms there's also good to note this if you're working on an antenna in massachusetts an antenna apps are already have the plas billed for them ated time so we wouldn't add any pla numbers for those but i here in storms on the remarks tab okay the tpg will right click add paste the remark to add and then under here start typing tpag and that's there so we'll click okay and you should double check i think we've checked enough here so this should be right but a good thing to know about the remarks is once you've added them they can't be edited or deleted so if you need to change something afterwards you'll need to say please disregard the previous billing remark and then whatever is needs to be done so i'll click ok now if there were any non billable police costs i would add another remark say something like save it were a hundred and thirty seven dollars i would say nonvillable police detail and i would copy this into the the remarks field and add a separate tpag remark but don't need that in this case so now the documents are going to need to be added so i'll need to put these into the onedrive folder not going to need these anymore so i'll just delete these so we have the construction sketch we need the exhibit five if i made any changes for the say like the secondary standard reference or something then i would chain add underscore today's date but didn't make any changes on this one so i'm just going to drag the exhibit five as it is and faa spreadsheet environmental checklist digsafe exchange a notice and construction sketch is already there if we had a customer outage list i would also drag that and also if there was a notice of excavation that too so now i'll go into storms and i'll add each of these one a time giving a description for the exhibit five i call it exhibit five and i'll copy the app name and make ready required i'll browse and hopefully i have access to the onedrive that tends to get lost in storms a lot but all right good so select the exhibit five change file size to one and find the most appropriate document type for the exhibit five we do have an exhibit five and click ok to add it also the construction sketch i just call it construction sketch please get put under sketches dig safe there were notice of excavation i'd call it notice of excavation and add that but in that in this case i'll add the environmental checklist there our customer outage list i'd just call it customer outage the faa spreadshe i like to add a note at the end so fa spreadsheet does not exceed notice criteria just so they can see from the notes that it didn't need to be to have a study submitted and there's nothing for the faa spreadsheet so other so is that all let's see usually this looks like we have six documents the exhibit five fa spreadsheet environmental checklist digsafe construction sketch and exchange a notice so i get into the exchange a notice so i'll yeah i think that's the last one for the exchange a notice the description should always be the number of pages instead of exchange a notice or anything like that so you need to just find in the file we see it has four pages so i'll just put four pages here and six or five von i believe that's just about done so there's a couple two more thing actually three more things i think basically we need to submit a request for a forest review since this is a since we had the tree trimming required we also need to do documents then submit the the application at the end but let's see right now i'll start working on the requirements i kind of like to send the forest re review email in the middle of this process because there's requirements involved for all poull replacements that are joint owned we need to add an optional requirement of eight forty this is only in new england not new york that's pullet nridjo set i'll double click make sure add to work order queue is checked and it's required and set this to ws underscore tco if we did need to to assign let's see a four sixty eight for an environmental checklist that would be here four sixty eight secure environmental permit and we'd have to assign that to somebody based on the district that'll vary input the context in the chat after let see if there's a highway permit required we need to add four thirty six secureest permit and i that would get assigned to whoever is going to be doing the permit i usually just assign it to whoever has been taking the most recent permits from the highway permit spreadsheet we also need to add a requirement for digging this is done differently we have to go property right click properties yeah file properties permits okay then this comes up with when digsafe post scheduling is selected select d safe we see now reporting doesn't have anything so select this click save put a reporting double click this and we get this window and there's a let me see there's you just keep a copy of this i'll post it in the chat in a minute fark required by field bigsafe needs to be called by field and click okay and that populates there the two fifty five environmental checklist complete this one we can complete because we completed the environmental checklist and we would do that whether or not it needs the four sixty eight we should double check that existing requirements are completed right the two fifty three needs to be added and complete the two eighty three needs to be added and complete there's just three that we need to set to not required this is the four eighty one double click here set set this part to not required you can click n to do that also that's seven twelve and seven thirteen so that's everything but the forestry review so now we'll need to send an email along with this we need to find the context this is neo nine i think it's a little bit complicated i have some notes for this i think they're in work the main work order resources too want to find the most recent copy of mass forestry contacts i'll close this i don't need this one don't save so neo nine it says zac hickey for this but there's also mike gallant for other other areas there's some maps available they should be on the i'll make sure they're in the main work order resources file our folders the north map here the west is divided into a few different parts so to find who we want to assign it to we'll figure out where we are we're in munson so this is to the southeast we're near east longmado so that just i guess this is generally the far west northampton north adams great barrington and lennox so anything northampton that's considered far west great barrington these areas so i pretty sure the first contact zack hickey is going to be the western contact over here so i will assign it to him there's two requirements that would need to be added along with the email add optional requirements this one we can add automatically this is going to be two thirty six forestry review and we'll click okay sometimes it gets automatically assigned if it doesn't we need to assign it you can if you click the i button there it'll bring up a search this is zach hickey make sure assign to work order eue is checked now the other one we have to do manually it's specific note we add the six thirty seven so company tree trimming required make sure add to work order queue is checked and here choose zach hicy again so now for the mail there's a format we tend to go by see i try to keep a few just text that i'm going to add this is going to be see the subject the forestry review so just that the work request we'll need a tree trimming estimate for the following polls i'll fill everything in i think we just need the work order number for this one once in put the isp threety it's thirty three dash four find this from the construction sketch thirty three dash four maxwell road this is by ninety seven maxwell road and the coordinates cy again are you able to send us any of like the cheat sheets that you have like the notes that you've you know accrued over the years of you doing this that have helped make your job easier that could potentially help make us have an easier transition doing this kind of work yeah i'll try to condense it down to something i'll definitely send the the see you list the emails but i know i a lot of it is changed and i haven't really cleaned up them so i'll try to i'll send something about for those okay cool thank you so much i really appreciate that so for this one we need to insert the construction sketch and that's all we need to attach for this i haven't usually copied anyone for this one we may be requested to copy them are you on teddy yes i'm back on all right would you do you want us to be copying anyone on the forestry review requests or you think it's okay without them cc me yeah these are massachust so cc me on the request that way if whoever requested it is either away on vacation or and the work is handed over to somebody else i at least have a copy of it okay so's see this email send then so now that that's done there's just one last requirement and that's the two seventy gate this is kind of the last step when we're just about ready to to submit now i will i'll prepare another email and this is going to be the submission email see the title work request work management ready for review i'll fill that out with the app name and recorder number is going to go to bob clter i'll get pull these from helix so make sure you have the app name work request there ready for review please review the attached documents that are ready for design and approval this work order make ready workest work request was completed by brendan earlierary put your name there or here we need to attach the just the exhibit five and the construction sketch for these i copy ngesign at osmos com and teddy and jacob for the subject two i'm going to assign this to i send this to bob couter and also robert leonida so that's ready to assign i'll just finalize everything so design approval make sure this is assigned to bob coulter and just and helix a couple of quick things all right so let's good to check the cost at the end just make sure if there is a cost there then we have to get rid of that and service details enter zero for the tgen joint number and then check the estimate again calculate on pc and that should go away so that's done all right so and requirements are assigned so here enter and custom fields expense site type should be right this is usually capital enter this four thousand eight twenty seven twenty six then workflow if you it needs to be qc' put in work order qc required if not just put work order written complete that reassign to bob coulter click okay okay and at this point i'll send the email so that's basically submitted then just the very final step is we want to make sure the invoices configuration is set so we just have to add the the stipia here since it's the capital just select all hspace paste that we didn't any if we need any prem marks we need to make sure it's checked so this is thirty three dash four premark required we didn't need any gis edits if there were a guy we would have to specify in the premark comments where the stake is going to go so say like for example place stake sixteen feet from poll opposite primary or something and i believe that should be it if there's a permit required we need to check that for the highway permits once that's all done then we can just change the poll status it's for now we're going it's work order in progress at this point we'll select them all h space change this to initial work order complete click apply assignment mark completed it's ready for next d if it's being qcd check work order qcq otherwise check work order complete click okay and change it to work order complete click yes so now reload the assignment it'll be assigned to work order complete change this to work order complete this time click apply and then assignment mark completed and click yes and it should say it's changed to delivered and that's the full process so there may be different things in different cases where we that may complicate things but that is the overall way to write a poll replacement work order so i guess at this point does anyone have any questions right if not then i gu that's it we can just be done and everyone have a nice day yeah before we close up for the for the day i am going assign you guys small applications that have one work management point so that way you guys have an application already assigned to you once you guys are able to start an application for work order so brendon i believe i assigned you several one poll applications i'm going to reassign those to this team all right okay yeah should i'm so sorry so we won't be able to start those until we get our actual like our own national grid access right correct okay yeah you should i think you are the only one here i've run they also need credentials andid credentials or you have your own anid credentials already that i don't know for you need to get into gis yes i'm able to get into okay i'm all right so you're able to get into national grid systems all right so yeah pig now we'll need to get you your own national grid credentials and okay we're going to okay sounds good yeah because i need the oalc and google earth and stuff like that too so i guess i'll just if you guys have any examples of already completed and approved ones that maybe i can like go through and look at how they look that' be cool okay you say you need a google earth yeah i don't have google earth and i don't have access to oalc and then i also don't have any national grid credentials just yet so okay i'll get together with you and we willll create it tickets to get those applications added to your laptop and national grid credentials we'll have to wait but we'll get a game plan going all right thanks for the awesome thank you so much thank you as well thanks again for your time everyone have a good rest of your day you you thank you brandon thanks brandon

TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] the right pole number can' really tell it's hard to see but thisve this image is from twenty nineteen so that's a little dated i'm going to go back to our survey photos here eight eight seven one eight seven five sixty one b three five six one b three it's that pole got multiple multiple down guys interesting insulator stuff going on here all right so let's move this over here looks like we're just raising secondary here so sixty one fifty three looks like we got triplex here running through the on the corner which is why we have the guying that we're seeing here it looks like we have telco and two power down guys two primary down guys almost wonder if that's not i don't think it's a twenty five m i think they're just two single twelve point fives and this photo' is useless and this photo is pretty useless here's our anchor photo so this anchor has three eyes one two three and all the eyes are taken so there are three down guys on the pole and they're all attached to the same anchor telco i believe is probably the the low com here yep and then comcast is already attached at twenty one so this is telephone comcast triplex and then you have primary three phase primary on a very strange looking corner armless configuration here right so let's go into the pole forty four the csv forty four length and class are actuals so that makes sense with gis and then from the design on the design side thirty three six so that corresponds with like a forty so we didn't measure anything that was different from what was in gis so there's no pole height and class updates that need to be made going to leave the form and pole number as is because not really sure there's one there or if that is the form pole number but i'm going to go just going to leave that blank because i don't feel good about it but there are multiple down guys here on one anchor now gis is only showing the one anchor which is good because there's only one anchor in the field even though there was three down guys attached to it so let's go into that anchor object anchor showing as a tta which corresponds with the number of eyes that we have we have three down guys three eyes the ownership is national grid telephone that's likely because verizon national i telephone or verizon has their own down guy on the anchor so it's a join on anchor the lead length is blank there's nothing in the lead length so we're going to go in here and three eyes a nine foot we length i'm just going to update this to nine yellow button to update and then i'm going to go into the anchored guy wires to just confirm that what we have in the field corresponds to what's in here there's two down guys it looks like two primary down guys which does correspond with what's in the field because they are well above secondary they're in the primary zone and so i'm going to change this to primary y that to twelve point five national grid we'll leave that we'll go to the other one same thing here twelve point five primary and i'm getting rid of the ownership this should be national grid not going to have joint owned individual wires and so now we've done our gis edits for this one i'll make a note of what we updated so let's see we did some guying edits now the description of work already has a notode in here saying that tree trimming is required we will always still need to evaluate whether or not we think that tree trimming is required because we're looking at it from a work order standpoint and we'll be looking at so we're going raise secondary here and so maybe we're going to be looking at something that wasn't potentially looked at and design for tree trimming so just because it says tree trimming here doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be required we're going to verify that so tree trimming and let's probably go to street theld here because it's probably going to be easier to see it even though this is a little dated and so what we're doing for work here is we're taking we raising secondary twelve inches per this standard so we're raing we're raising this wire up twelve inches so what they're going to do with the work from a work orderd perspective what we're going to capture with cost units eventually is they're going to install a new bracket twelve inches up here they're going to detach the triplex from the old bracket transfer it to the new bracket and then remove the old bracket that's what's going happen here with this work from a work order perspective when we get into cost units we would add cost units tied to all of those aspects so one of what we need to do when we're evaluating tree trimming is do any trees or branches need to be trimmed in order for this work to be completed now graant we're keeping in mind that you it's twenty nineteen and it's a little dated but at least it'll give us an idea of what the spans look like in relation to the trees so right off the bat i see tree branches that are extending beyond the position of where triplex is now these trees might be lower it might be a perspective where you know maybe they're impacting only the cols like it looks like this branch is tied up with the coms here but it is actually tied up with triplex on this side so i would probably in order to and i'm assuming now that this is still the case you know let's go back in into our survey photo which leaves us kind of wishing for better coverage here but there's this tree over here and where was it it's like it's starting out i can't really measure one it's right about where that first cinder block is so it looks like it might have been up in here somewhere but it's hard to tell if it's still there and then it's hard to see the next pole because these branches are on the tree in the foreground so i mean based on this i see that wire and i see branches or limbs that are in front of it so that like right there implies to me that there's some sort of tree trimming required i think the clearance that they need from secondary for tree trimming is eighteen inches so there's actually in that work order resources folder there's a tree trimming folder and forestry construction standards so this just gives you the idea of what sort of clearances that they're going to be looking for from a tree trimming perspective so like when you're kind of eyeballing it generally i err on the side of over calling for tree trimming because what we're doing is we're not really saying that absolutely tree trimming is required here we're just saying that based on the resources that we have available to us we think that tree trimming is needed to perform this work what we're going to do is we're actually going to take the construction sketches and send that to a forestry triming team at national grid they're going to go out in the field they're going to look at the span they're going to look at the work and then they're going to come up with the cost associated with it so we're just basically flagging the potential need for it so i would err on the side of over calling for it we'd rather call for tree trimming and have it not needed then not call for it and have it needed because if they have to pause the job they're ready to go off to do construction and then they get out there and there's a giant tree that needs to be cut that's going to stop the progression of that job because they're going to have to call the tree trimming crews out they're going to have to so we want to i would err on the side of over calling than under calling and then this table just kind of gives you an idea of the types of clearances that they're looking for out in the field like it's hard for us to gauge eighteen inches in this on a horizontal plane using survey photos or street view photos so we're just kind of eyeballing things here and that's why i kind of just was like okay well there's at least some branches that are nearby even if this wasn't in front i would still probably call for tree trimming just because this span here is right along this wooded line there's twenty nineteen it's been five years there's probably some growth here that i can't see with street view or my survey photos now sometimes you can go ahead to the next the next pole in your line and then look back at the span to help like say that didn't help either that gives us what the front span the pole the anchor and that's it there's no backspan photo on that one it looks like that's not really helpful so sometimes you can use the other poles on either side to help you figure out tree trimming needs here i'm going to call for tree trimming on this span let's look at the other span so this one actually you know it's on the pole and it actually crosses out across our driveway here or parking lot so i would probably call for no tree trimming on this side and so what i'm going to do is so we want tree trimming in the this is the north arrow here in google maps at the bottom right hand corner so the northwest side so i'm just going to add to my e five here so that tree trimming required is legit leave that there i'm going to put in my notes here tt northwest side so that's a note to me when i'm actually going in and doing my construction sketches later on in the process that tree trimming is required and i'm going to need to add some symbols in my construction sketches to reflect that tree trimming is needed on that span dying edits tree trimming is needed on the northwest side the last piece that i want to evaluate is access pole access well we're actually on private property now so this is all like they would not there's no police protection involved with this because this is not like a roadway this is all within the walmart parking lot so i would probably call this off road work because it's off the main roadway where there would be police protection of some sort so i would probably just call this off road work and we would not call for police protection so what i'm going to do is in here in bold i'm going to put off road work so we kind of assume that if we don't put anything about pole access that police protection or flagging is required and only if there's something beyond police protection will we add anything about pole access in here off road work is one the other is rear lot work okay and i'm going to go into back into that process dock because there's actually a section called accessing the pole roadside off road and rear lot work oh look i actually updated that recently we call for police protection in new england so roadside roadside then off road is poles accessible by truck but requires the truck to go off road possibly across grass fields or private property this one on my parking lot and we would add off road work in bold on the e five rear lot work is the pole is not accessible by the truck in its arm and it might be in a very heavily wooded area there might be steep grade there could be a fence blocking it basically the truck is not going to be able to drive up to the pole with its pocket arm to do the work these are oftent times where they'll have like a track machine or utvs or whatever to drive out to the job site to do the work that comes with additional costs so when we do a rear lot work we're going to actually add additional cost to the job if we do run into those because it's going to cost more money for national grid to go in and do the work rather than if they have to just pull up on the side of the road and do it so that's what we're looking at when we're talking about accessing the pole it's going to be roadside work which would just be police protection off road which actually could potentially be police protection because if say out here and i don't really have a good example but we'll pretend that this pole here we're working on and has a span that crosses the street and goes over to here and we were moving that span so chances are this pole was off road you know maybe they were accessing it over there so they don't need protection for doing the work because the police protection is for the protection of the crew doing the work so they don't have you know some guy coming down the road and start plowing into utility workers they don't need protection to do the work over here maybe they're just parked in this parking lot here or they're parked over here but there was a span an imaginary span that i just made up that crossed this highway or this roadway so it was technically off road work but maybe they still needed the police protection for that transfer because they're going to have to stop traffic on this main road in order to move this w that was crossing over so roadside work is usually has some sort of protection off road work can have police protection rear lot work generally no police protection and like so if we had a pole that was out in the middle of these woods here you know they'd probably have to go and find the easiest access point and then they would have to drive out or bushwack or whatever to get to that spot i mean you see it a lot with like this is probably a transmission line yeah that looks like a transmission line so let's do a little street view action here you so if they're doing work down in the right away here they might not be able to drive their truck up to access those poles way down the line yeah there might be a little pathway in there but they're not getting their bucket truck down the line there so they would probably just park pull off the side of the road and have a track machine or atv to cruise down to the pole to actually do the work and there's just extra labor associated with that so so back to our job i'm just going to say off road work op or labor ms here pt we did some edits that one's good and then the last pole would work oh look the last poull in the sixty one fifty seven so i'm just kind of repeating the process the steps that i had just previously done i'm going to go grab the image numbers from my csv six one five seven that's last and last just pull on the app last image is in the csv this one has a length in actual of forty four which corresponds to gis and our design what are our image numbers here eight seven through nine two so seven to two and then i'm just going to pull up my just do that i forget to use but you can actually have you tabs so you can duplicate the tab and then have another your work order resources maybe duplicate the tab and have your you images all within this window and the problem i have is that i always forget that there's multiple tabs and i'll just go ahead and close it but so images we're going to eight eight eight seven to nine two ohfully we got a well there's a telco tag stencil anyways that's telling me that maybe the telco tag was probably under here but can't really see what's going on a bunch of risers on this pole one two three steel pipes this looks like this is usually the down ground for the transformer usually it's in a little plastic casing with the staples and then these are the riser pipes associated with primary risers and com risers so let's see what we got oh boy well we' raising secondary there's probably tree trimming because the branches on the backside here i don't think we're actually raising secondary i think we're just doing guying work here so let's see on the other side of the pole gosh kind of white out here there's another angle the other side where' is that it there it is okay that doesn't really help us all that much but you got a primary riser here three phase like corresponds with what's in gis three phase primary overhead into a riser oh there's our i skip went the wrong way so we have our primary down guy we have a secondary down guy looks like we have oh no primary down guy no secondary and then this is the telco i'm assuming down guy but is there an anchor shot i wonder let's look at the csv here the anchor photo is eight eight nine two eight eight nine two so there's our anchor so that the that was the actual right photo so three eyes so it's a tta one two down guys and we established that one was the telco and one is a primary we can check gis now i would probably rotate the anchor a little bit just because i want it to look more like it's offsetting the secondary or primary this is something that we haven't actually done yet but to rotate the object i can actually go select the object and there's a rotate by dragging option so you can click on that and that will change your icon to this little rotate button and then you can actually rotate the object in its place from the vertex so you can spin it around all you want i just kind of wanted to make it look a little bit more like primary here and it's tta as we've established it's also a join own because we've got both national i mean national grid and verizon on the same anchor here so it's a joint ownership here we're going to go to the csv grab the lead length so that's nine point five nine and a half we're going to round that up to ten and do a lead length of ten because you can do decimals in here leave this as is update going into my anchored guy wires and this is where i'm going to update this thirteen m to a five we're going to do this primary grounded five this one has cutouts that's what this is three dash sixty five t typically primary risers are going to have cutouts that's what these are you can they're kind of washed the lighting is washed out the fuse tubes but i can get behind the walmart up north is the other way all the way back there i like seen all those solar panels that's probably what the primary riser is going into you can see the probably the meters associated with this pad but if we look up three phase primary two of them are dead ending on the cross arm one's dead ending on the pole and then you have cutouts one two three the cutout is that's the cutout body and the fuse tube and then the bracket associated with it that will come in handy when we do the cost units because when we replace cutouts or we do cutout work we're replacing potentially three different things the fuse tube body and the bracket associated with it so that'll come into play l down so three cutouts there's also three lightning arresters they are here here and here there's also three terminations for the riser to go underground here here and here and the wires all go underground down this pipe and it looks like these two over here are abandoned or you know whatever was going underground here is no longer going into those pipes or maybe they add so let's see it's hard to tell like this wire is curving around so maybe there's a ris oh it looks like they might be some risers on the backide here that go further up for the coms there or that might be the primary on the opposite side but so that's what we're looking at and then you have your primary down guide here got what looks like just secondary triplex with your three phase primary up top so the cutouts as i was pointing to before there are t lengths and there size sixty five according to gis these are considered line cutouts as opposed to cutouts that protect transformers we looked at cutouts that protected a transformer before this is this is really just protecting the riser but they're not associated with a transformer they' kind of like line cutouts this is considered a major piece of equipment so if we were doing gis edits that would be we would be doing edits on this pole if it was no make ready all right so about you guys but i'm kind of toast at this point so we've done g edits here what do we do we did some guying on tree trimming now i think i did say that it looks like there might be that angle although this is survey i mean and this isn't survey that's old street view so if we go into survey you it kind of looks like there's potential for tree trimming here on the other side but we're not actually doing any work with the secondary if we were doing work on the pole before it and we were raising secondary we would be considering tree trimming on this span but because we're only doing for work we're installing an anchor and down guy all we really care about is tree trimming for that particular work itself now what do we have on this side we got a big tree and the down guide that's going in the middle of it so i am going to call for tree trimming on this for this particular work look in order to add the down guide and again we're from twenty nineteen so you know you we got to go through these trees these branches in order to install that new down guy and they might need to do some tree trimming there to in order to do the work so we're going to call for tree trimming at the pole or anchor here so going to come down into our description work here now there was no tree trimming note here i'm going to add in trimming then i'm going to add a note here that says pt or really the that way this is just me being me i like to see everything in order trimming required po okay and so we've finished the gis edits for that pole as well now one thing i didn't do all along here and i probably should have is i probably should have been saving as i went along because gis has a funny way of you know kicking you out when you least expect it now one thing i will note is that generally when you get kicked out in the middle of work and you go back in most times it'll take you right back to where you were and you won't lose anything which is huge so in order to save we're just going to hit the little save button here and then that's saving that work to this file alternative now we've done we've reviewed the gis edits for the polls with a ready i did not see any real major equipment noted here on the e five beyond like the primary riser generally they would be listing the major equipment anyways so we've done the gis edits for the work for this application so technically we should be done with gis edits at this point any questions with that i mean obviously a lot of information and i mean this was pretty straightforward there was a couple down guy edits and that was just kind of about it you know and every application is going to be different you know but i'll tell you most of the stuff that you're going to be editing is going to be guying related or you know adding missing risers or updating a form poll number you know very rarely are you going in and doing like crazy amounts of gis edits so i'm done with this i'm going to i't i didn't already saved it so we're good with that and now i want to design complete it because i want to take those changes that i made and i want to push those to top to the gis server so that way when i start my work order and open up my gis design the changes that i made in this file alternative will be reflected in that gis design so to do that we go to file change statete in gis and then it'll go you sure of course i am sure if there was some sort of issue with your design or what you did it will throw an error at this point and you'll see that it kind of cycles through from proposed to read only and then it will close it out altogether and that file that file alternative is you can't reopen it you can't go back in and update it update something in it to repost it it's gone so if you needed to go back in and make another change you need to go in and create a completely different file alternative and a message is going to pop up here shortly that'll say the estimates have been sent to storms every time you send estimates to storms or design complete estimates are going to be sent to storms and this little message viewer will pop up where is it it'll pop up in this here and it's kind of like a little email box and that message will pop up and we can just i'll select it and delete it and that and then we're ready to kind of start our work order but i'm going to pause there it's probably a time to take our lunch or break or whatever everyone's doing but we had a good good session today i think we're going we're going to stop it there for now and i don't know i'll check with what time does everyone work till ooot there's our message this is the message i was looking for basically it's just saying hey we've successfully posted the file alternative is what this is saying and so you could you know select it mark it as red and it's just going to keep bothering you it's going to keep flashing it's going to keep on popping up so i usually select it to mark it as red and then delete it and i keep this pretty empty you'll get messages as you go you know you start doing more and more of these work orders you're going to do more and more of these designs the designs are going work their way through storms and they're going to progress through various states so you might be opening up gis and getting messages about jobs that you had wrote the work order for months before because it's just showing you that this job that you wrote you know back in august or whatever has progressed to that next stage and it's getting posted to top or it's you know progress to the next status so that's what will be shown in this little message view so we are done with the gis edits portion and the next steps would be to begin the writing the work order now what does everyone work for hours because i'd like to set up an additional or additional training sessions this week what does what's i mean i usually start at a what time does people do people usually work till what time do people usually take their lunches so i usually work eight to five but i'm on central time so i'm in hour mntal time so you're in so it's it's an hour behind us yeah it's twelve forty right now where i'm at okay usually our date to five but i'm also super flexible so i earlier later that's yeah cool so what about you you see ivan yeah about eight to five saying same thing five for you yeah yeah lunch is you know whenever twelve one yeah whenever whenever' i usually take i've always been i always take later lunches take late lunches when you come back there's less time on the til right right whatever fal with me right what about you john megan typically i usually like try to start i'm starting like seven thirty to one thirty and then i get my kit off the bus and then i make up hours later and today i'm opennt openntil five so for me it's usually seven to three and lunch is usually twelve or one whenever i can get in okay all right so i think we're going to grab lunch and i think we're going i think we're going to pick up with this training again tomorrow i'll probably put something on the calendar for the same time if that works for everyone and we'll do kind of do a similar similar to what we did today except tomorrow we'll probably just pick up where we left off and continue writing this thing does that does that work for everyone okays great all right so what i'll do is we'll take out a lunch and now before we do that what's everyone working on let's because just because we're jumping off training doesn't mean that i am unable to help people so if folks are actually working on things and need help it looks like josh you have a one poll with work and poll replacement app john you have that one that we were working on together looks like megan you've got one that has just looks like power make ready so oh and then's see what are you working on looks like you got yourself a poll replacement as well so after we take our lunch and if anyone has questions or if you guys want to just hop on another call to go over questions on your apps i'm all for it whatever you guys want to do you know i'm open to so i'm going to stop sharing right now and i think i'm going to stop the recording i don't really let's see you go to stop the recording here let's see anyone know how to stop the recording those three little dots there one there should be the record transcribe and then stop okay stop recording all all right

TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] okay guys i' here today from the great john danner again so guys today john is going to show us here what are the three most important things as jitsu whiterow should know so what are the three most importantitsu techniques that a res jitsu white br guy person should know so we've got this question all the time and how would you answer that there's a sense in which it's an impossible question because jujitsu is it's an ocean of moves so to say okay what are three important things for me to know three important techniques because the question was head is what are the three most important techniques for us to know now i'm sure you'll agree with me berardo the most important things when a beginner first comes in are usually concepts they're something that which can govern your behavior across a wide spectrum of situations everybody's techniques tend to be relativized more to okay you're in this scenario here apply this technique and see what happens but nonetheless it's still a very important question you know at the end of the day you only win a match when you go out and apply techniques you can talk all day about concepts this and principles that but at the end of the day you've got to apply a technique on a resisting opponent and only that way can you actually win a match so it's an important question and i believe i have three candidates which we can illustrate in this video which will make you more effective in your first week in jiu jitsu and on throughout your time in the sport and which also illustrates some important lessons which have important carryovers into your further development as you go further down the line so i'm going to start the ball rolling by saying the absolute most important move in all of jiujitsu but none is the elbow escape okay this move goes by several different names classically it was always called the elbowcape there's a sense in which that can be a slightly misleading name but don't worry we'll explain it now and it how to makes sense to you okay first let's understand what the hell is an elbow escape an elbowcape is a situation where i start in a poor position pinned by my opponent we need to start off by defining a pin in the sport of brazilian jiu jitsu in the sport of wrestling anytime my back and shoulders are on the mat you're pinned okay and jiu jitsu you have to go further than that it's only when my opponent locks one of my shoulders down to the mat and he's gotten past my legs and he has some kind of direct chest to chest contact or in some cases knee to stomach contact only then does he count as pinning me okay so if i'm on my back then my opponent is in front of my legs yes i'm on my back but this is not a pin because bernato is not past my legs however bernato should control my legs and go past and then from here start to come up and control my head and shoulders etc okay now he's pinning me understand also that there are different kinds of pin here right now bernardo is settling for one of the most popular all round pins in the sport the side pin he could for example transition to a knee on belly pin where he comes up places the knee on my stomach and from here he gets additional points in a pin like this he could also transition his hands to the mat go forward into the mounted position and from here he's taking a different form of pin okay and this scores even more points for him in the situation the pin he's still pinning me's still in the category of pins but it's a different kind of pin if i make the mistake for example of turning my back and berardo starts moving around they create a situation where his two legs hook into my hips now he has a different kind of pin this is a very interesting one because now he's no longer chest to chest he's chest to back interestingly in the sport of juitsu even if bernato ended up in bottom position here he would still count as pinning me in this situation you can see that the notion of the pin is quite different in the sport ofuitsu to most grappling knivs it's not necessarily top and bottom it has more to do with your body position relative to the legs than it does to top or bottom most of the time it's the top man is pinning provided he's faster legs but a situation like this i'm technically on top of bernato even if we come all the way up here now i'm definitely on top of them but still i'm in bernardo's pin because he's past my legs and he's established this hooks in upper body control etc etc so you see that the notion of pinning is quite interesting in the sport ofjitsu has to do with the idea of getting past your opponent's legs and fixing yourself to either chest to chest or chest to back position with certain kinds of constraints in mind as you control the position now if there's one method that's going to get you out of these pins which trumps all the others put together it's the elbow escape okay let's start off by looking at different variations of the elbowcape and showing how it creates a situation where your opponent is passed your legs the act of elbow escaping is essentially the act of putting your opponent back inside your legs now as a complete beginner of the sport you might be asking okay what's so special about that you're still on your back i don't care if you put your legs in front of him or not it means nothing to me well we're going to go on to show other techniques after the elbow escape which will show you the value of putting your opponent back inside your legs you can go from a situation where you're completely losing a match to one where you can absolutely turn it around and win from underneath your opponent provided your legs are involved in the movements so putting your opponent back inside your legs after the pin you is a big big deal in this sport basically the entire bottom game of jiu jitsu is almost all centered around the idea of keeping my legs between myself and my opponent if he gets past my legs and gets his upper body pins he's winning if i can keep my legs between myself and my opponent i have an excellent chance of winning even from bottom position so let's have a look at a situation where i got off to a dreadful start and my opponent got mounted on top of me okay even a complete beginner can see that this is a bad bad situation for me and a very good one for bernado okay in situations like this we want to form a frame where one forearm goes across my training partner's hips so that if bernado tries to walk forward with his knees and get into a higher and higher mount it's quite difficult for him i take my elbow and i put it inside my training partner's knee i'm going to start actively looking to invert my knee so that my knee points down to the floor and my foot is higher than my knee if my knee is higher than my foot and i try to perform an elbow escape i'm just going to run helplessly into my opponent's hamstring and i'm never going to get a hold of my opponent's leg so i have to create a situation where i take my foot higher than my knee and by doing this i can easily scoop my knee underneath bernardo's ankle and capture it the way we capture it is by going across the second leg and locking just like so now i've captured the ankle i need to transfer now to the knee so i started at the ankle now i just turn my hips watch bernado's knee it comes off the mat and as a result it's very easy for me to go around the corner and capture the whole knee if we bring the camera around on this side now now i'm going to repeat the process on the opposite side i'm going to take my elbow and put it inside bernardo's knee and as a result i can shift my hips and bring my foot higher than my knee so that as a result my knee comes through like so now if we bring the camera further around now there's a potential problem when i try to take my foot out it gets caught and i feel it would take some kind of extraordinary flexibility on my part to get my legs around my opponent but if i plant my foot and shift my hips the angle changes between us and as a result it's very easy for me now to lock my ankles around my training partner's lower back at this point you are no longer pinned yes you are still on your back but you now have a situation where you're out of the immediate danger of the pin and from here we'll soon be showing you can get on the offense so once again let's have a look at the situation br the camera back around berado gets off to a strong start and goes into a mounted pin we start things rolling by getting a hand across and locking a frame where one of my elbows goes inside his knee i never want situations where my arms are around my opponent like so where my opponent can easily get to a higher and higher position and threaten me with all kinds of nastiness from the situation back down bonato so we want to fram across the hip and inside the knee now i turn onto my side there's a world of difference between being flat on my back where i'm not particularly effective and one where i turn onto my side where i can be highly effective now from here my foot goes higher than my knee and as a result we can easily bring our training partner's ankle into a position where we can lock the figure of four around that ankle and then turn to get his knee off the mat and as a result make a good catch now i came around on this side i bring my elbow inside my training partner's knee on the opposite side i shift my hips out i bring my knee inside bernardo's hip and we shift the second time so that from here we can quickly lock up a closed guard on our training partner this we a classic escape from the mounted position understand that the elbow escape is the most versatile of all the methods of escape in the sport of jujitsu it works on almost all of the major pins so for example bernado's across my side and it's now pinning me in a classic side pin from the situation i bring my elbow inside my training partner's hip i bring my knee to my training partner's hip here i put my foot higher than my knee so that as i shift my hips out i find the perfect angle to bring my elbow and knee together and as a result from here we can start pushing on our training partner's hits and aligning our body with our training partner if we bring the camera around in this direction here now it's an easy thing for me to plant my foot on the floor once again if bernardo's knee comes towards me you'll notice that my foot is stuck and it's difficult for me to bring my legs around my opponent no problem weant the foot we shift our hips out we form an angle where even an inflexible person like myself can easily lock up around and we find ourselves once again in a close guard situation again we've recovered our legs with our legs around our opponent we're in a position where we can start to get on the attack so once again side pin situation berardo is here in an excellent pinning position we take our elbow bring it inside the hip we take our foot higher than our knee and we start the action of scooting our hips out as our hips go further and further away from our opponent we get more and more space to bring our legs between ourselves and our opponent as my knee goes to bernato's hips we shift our body we align with our training partner and from here we have more than enough space to bring our legs around and lock a so called close guard position on our training partner and now we're ready to fight from bottom alternatively from a situation where bonnado is behind me and has two hooks in the elbow escape will work just fine in this situation too first things first this is a potentially very dangerous situation where bernato got a hold of my lapels he could start strangling me here so this is a serious serious problem okay so what we want to do here is always to monitor our training partner's strangulation hand that's the one that comes over my shoulder and could potentially strangle me in this position so we want to make sure we monitor that hand and lock it in place defensively like so now even as bernato holds the position i'm going to use the fingers of my training partner's strangling hand to point the direction of my escape the escape starts with the head we're going to take our feet we're going to plant a foot and i'm going to turn my foot outwards i want to fall in this direction as a general rule bernardo will be interested in me falling in this direction here okay there are some variations to that but it's a good general rule now i want to determine which way i fall i don't want him determining which way we fall how do i win this i take one foot and plant it now bernardo is going to try and take me to the right side i'm going to use my left foot to turn out as bernato goes to my right by straightening my leg i force bernardo in the opposite direction he wanted okay once again from a seated position bernardo wants to take me to the right i don't care i just put my foot plant it watch my left foot turns and my toes point the direction i force him to go now as he hooks in tight with his legs i want to beat this bottom hook how are we going to do this i'm going to swis my legs toward that he can make strong hook berato i take my foot back inside his and i turn my knees to face the ceiling bernardo wants his head beneath mine so i take my head forward and i put my head underneath his as a result we're able to push forward on our training partner and bring our knee over his foot there's not much danger of a strangle now so as i monitor his strangle hand i don't let him go any side grabbing my lapels i tap over my training partner's ankle and i start moving out and away there's a danger now that bernato will start getting up on top of me into the mounted position so we perform an elbow escape we go over the top as bernardo gets up on top of me now ta top position we finish the elbow escape and capture our training partner's leg now from this position we go through elbow goes inside the knee foot goes in shrimping our body out and once again we perform the elbow escape to put our opponose back in down so once again berardo's behind me in a very strong attacking position first monitor the strangle hand we can't have someone just going and strangle us while we're trying to escape so we monitor the strangle hand we bring our feet together i want to force him to fall this way okay even bernardo makes a strong resistant body i do this by planting the foot and i turn my leg outwards and as a result we determine which side we fall towards now i want to beat this hook as he pulls it tight with this hook look how i walk my leg back until i can get a situation going where i can step over that annoying bottom leg we i step over it get my hips out and get everything down towards the floor one big problem that many people have here if we bring the camera in is head position as long as bernato's head is below mine it's very hard for me to escape so let's take the time to bring our head forward and get bottom head position that's going to make it much easier for us to get our shoulders down to the mat our elbow down to the floor now bernato iss forced to come up on top of him look at i catchure berado's ankle make that figure of four that we're always looking for and then we just give a simple push and capture his leg and like so now we bring the camera on this side ar goes up from here we put our elbow inside his knee we complete the elbow escape by bringing our knee there in front of his hip shrinking our hips out to the side as we result we can quickly lock up a closed guard now can you see a pattern emerging here in the mounted escape the side escape and the back escape we always ended with our legs locked around our training partner's hips and waist we went from a situation where we're pinned our opponent had gotten past our legs and he's got a strong dominant pin we put them into a situation where we had them in closed guard now an obvious question for you as a complete begintner in the sp is okay what's so special about that i look at this closed guard doesn't look a lot better to me than where you were before if i was still on top of you right understand something yes his upper body is still on top of me when we're in a closed guard okay so if berardo gets mounted his chest and shoulders are on top of me but more importantly his hips are on top of my hips that's the real problem that's why it's a strongly dominant position now bonardo go to my closed guard b if i elbow escape and i put bonardo in a closed guard yes his upper body is still on top of me but you'll notice that my hips are on top of his hips so even though he has upper body top position i have lower body top position even though it looks on the surface on a superficial manner from a superficial point of view that he's on top of me the part of our bodies that's the most important my hips are on top of his so it's not obvious that this is an inferior position yes my upper body's underneath them but my lower body is actually on top of his lower body and as a result we can start doing good work from here one of the most important moves to start off bottom position from closed guard which will get you thinking in the right terms in the sport of jujitsu is to understand how we can use a position like closed guard which when you first see it doesn't look particularly promising and turn it into some magic where you can turn fights around from underneath so we're going to go through and we're going to take a cross cuff grip on our training partner's ge right here we're going to get a hold of our training partner's arm and we're going to pull our training partner's arm on by using our legs my legs pull inwards and as i break the grip we're going to send our training partner's arm straight on by into a position where the elbow has been beaten you have now gone halfway towards your opponent's back even though you're underneath your opponent you've beaten your opponent's arm so technically though you're underneath you're in a fine position to begin attacking what determines our ability to attack from here is our ability to get our head higher than his head so we're going to go through and hold ono our training partner's lap muscle we're going to now take our second arm and pull it out and start building up to an elbow so i come back on my elbow and i prop up on the elbow like so as a result my head is now higher than his head now what seemed like a rather unpromising situation your legs wrapped around your opponent you underneath them it's starting to look a damn sight better now you're halfway behind your opponent now from here we're going unweight our bottom leg by putting all the weight on the top leg because i'm higher than my opponent's hips it's very easy for me to slide around behind my opponent and start to go through into a fine attacking position i'm going to post my second leg inside at this point you can see we're traded places our opponent had a good pin on us and now you have a good chest to back pin on them so you've gone from a one hundred percent defensive situation to a one hundred percent offensive situation now from here we're going to go throw on our training partner make a strong bodyent and we're going to take a lapel grip on our training partner like so we're going to take our second hand don't worry i'll show you once we emerge from this top position and grab our opponent's opposite lapel as a result we can go down towards the floor and start the action of pulling our opponent on top of us if we bring the camera around in this direction let's just look at my hand position i've taken my thumb and gone inside my training partner's lapel and as a result we're now in a situation where i can use my left arm my left hand to take the slack out of my training partner's jacket by bringing the lapel down now from here we start to exert the strength of our legs into the strangulation i take my right foot and pass it over and inside my training partner's armpit so that i can employ a pushing force with my right leg as my two legs push away we get a strong pulling force as my entire body weight comes back into the strangle so as my head moves away from my opponent all my body weight goes back and into the strangle while all the strength of my legs goes forward into the strangle and it creates an immensely strong scissoring force which will strangle our opponent in a very short order of time so what have we got here what's the big picture we've got we've got a sense in which we started off in the spirit of jitsu in very poor defensive situation our opponent was in a powerful pin from where they could easily defeat us and we saw that the key to getting out of the pin situation in jujutu is to recover our legs we don't care if we get put on our back but we do care if we get put on our back and our opponent gets past our legs so your number one prerogative is to get your legs back between you and your opponent so that you can use the strength of your legs to wrestle a bigger stronger opponent from bottom position the absolute king of methods of doing this is the elbow escape and you would be well off if you just spent your first year in jiujitsu just practicing elbow escapes of course you need to know other things but that wouldn't be a bad start believe me now once you get good and ad deppt of the elbow escape you can get out of dangerous pins and start putting your opponent back in some variation of guard we looked at probably the most well known variation a close guard where our ankles lock around our opponent now when you first look at closed guard doesn't look that special it looks a little strange to be honest with you and it might not strike you as a position where you go up and win fights from but understand that because your hips are on top of your opponent's hips the most important part of your body is actually in top position even though the rest of your body is underneath your opponent and as a result you can start performing some incredible moves from there one of them turns the nature of the fight around completely that's a transition where i'm in closed guard to one where i beat my opponent's arm and swivel around behind my opponent taking advantage of the fact that my hips are on top of his hips and as a result we can get around into probably the most well known form of victory in the sport of jiujitsu the art of strangulation let's understand something about strangulation using the the lapels if we just take a se position if you look at berardo explain the camera if you look at berardo's jacket and of course my jacket too you'll see that the material involved in the lapel is very very similar in nature to the material of the belt and you will start to understand that really what the ge is and there's a very obvious sense in which the gear is simply a belt or a noose woven into a set of sleeves so you will see how the belt mirrors the action of the lapel and just as a rope around your training partner's neck could be used as a superb method of strangulation probably the most efficient method of strangulation so too this lapel is essentially that rope around your opponent's neck just as a murderer would use a rope to strangle so too a jiujitsu player can use this superb lapel as a murderer's rope around his opponent's neck we want to make use of it whenever we can now we're behind someone just as we could use this kind of strangulation technique with the belt so to we can go in on a training partner and create that same kind of effect of strangulation in fact we can do even better because here i'm only using the strength of my hands to enact the strangle but when we employ the dominant pins of ju we can start to employ by far and away the strongest part of the human body the legs if we bring the camera over here now as my legs pass over my training partner shoulders i have a pushing force with my legs and the pulling force of my entire body weight which creates incredibly strong strangulations the key idea in the strangles is the idea of slack removal when i go in on my training partner i want my second hand taking all the slack out of my training partner's lapels just as we work with a murderer's rope the idea here is we want to take the slack out of the noose here the noose is ineffective as a strangulation implement but once we create that ligature around our training partner's neck and take the slack out that's when it becomes a superb instrumental strangulation so two when we work in like so we use a two on one lapel feed we feed the lapel onto the thumb we bite our hand up into a strong strangulation position now the right hand takes all the slack out of the jacket i have never applied the strangle hand yet and you can see berard is already starting to feel the effects of the strangle now when the legs go over the top we have this incredible ability to use the legs to push and the upper body to pull and as a result create enormously strong strangulation so running through all of this very quickly now let's start off a mounted pin we're going to work our way out of the mounted pin using the elbow scape the king method of putting our legs back in a situation we can use our legs to fight our opponents upper body once we've done that we the close guard position and we use the fact that our hips are on top of our opponent's hips to shimmy around behind our opponent and go from an bottom position which is somewhat neutral to a strongly dominant position where you're behind your opponent and you can use the incredible power of strangulation to end the match in your favor so once again we start off not a mount situation we need to capture the foot first so our first target is going to be the foot we turn and capture the foot the second target is going to be the knee then if we bring the camera on this side we move around the body now the second sorry the third target is going to be this knee so we elbow escape and lock and then the fourth target is going to be our opponent's hips we go around the corner and capture the hips with our legs now even though i'm underneath bonardo my hips are on top of him so as bonato goes to assert grips on top of me here we're going go through and take our training partner's arm on vi i use my legs to pull my training partner around it looks like i'm pulling with my arms it's actually my knees pulling behind even with no hands you can see the pull with the knees is a very strong one however his bracing arm make strong braces bon will stop my legs pulling him in so we need to be able to take the arms on v to be able to pull in effectively with the legs now we've exposed our training partner's back so that even though we're underneath our hips are on top and as a result you can start the action shimming up to the side i build up to an elbow and get my head higher than his head as a result i can create an unweighted leg look how my left leg pulls my hips off the floor and my right leg becomes weightless and as a result we can quickly go in and start scoring a flying attacking position from here we fix up that first lapel grip from this position we go down towards the floor and we tilt our training partner over then from here we find either the wrist the second lapel and in some cases the pants okay they're all excellent alternatives but for now let's focus on slack removal to come in here and feed our leg over the top of our training partner and end up in the perfect position to go into strangulation the key element here is the use of the legs going in one direction and the upper body going in the other so that even with a single finger we can create enormously strong strangulation pressure so this creates a sense in which bonado we work with the key themes of the sport of jiujitsu the idea that ultimately we always want to be able to recover from a bad start okay if you look at an untrained fighter probably the single most common thing you see is if they get off to a bad start they never recover and they lose one of the great things about a juitsu player you can get off to a terrible start and come back strong the number one method of coming back strong the one that you'll be using throughout your time in the sport of jijutitsu is the elbow escape bardo i'm sure you agree with me that was probably your happiest first moments in jiujitsu by the time you first started hitting elbow escapely scared the from rory finger is very good because it's you did pretty much like an overview of like how to escape from a bad position from side control from l and from back then how to sweep and how to get it back because if you stop on top of her opp plan coming from w and let's consider a sweooep and you are also working this triangle so we covered the essential ideas of defense top and bottom position these are key themes in the sport of jitsu everything begins with defense okay you have to go to recover from a bad position then the idea of working effectively from bottom position one of the absolute key themes of jujitsu okay most grappling styles if you're on bottom you're losing simple as that and jujutu you can absolutely win almost all of your matches from bottom position if you so favor that method and then finding the idea of turning a situation where we were chest to chest with our opponent the one we were chest to back that's always our favorite thing if you can get behind people life's good okay that's an easy place to start winning fights from so as much as possible we're trying to push the dynamic of every match towards chest to back situations if we get chest to back that's when we can start taking advantage of this murdere's rope which is around our necks every time we put on a jacket if you can get a hold of that when you're behind people you're going to have a lot of success in the sport no that was no easy job was a great overview for all wide rods on there and also not only wide bs but i think it's always good to review all stuff doesn't matter i'm sure you agree with this the happiest times as teachers you have you come and teach a beginn's class are my favorite things to the are the fundamentals even though i'm mostly known as someone who teaches more advanced classes it's the fundamentals that always put the biggest smile on me so guys guys i hope you guys enjoy it and we' like you i do fundamental

VIDEO_ID: PreparingCustomerOutageList.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] right i'm going to now run through preparing the customer outage list for the application that i'm working on see i need to open up my gis design first it's that number recent project open that up so while that's doing that the process dock which is located under work order resources your process documents there's a make ready work order process ten tenenty five there's a customer outage list section there and explains when you need to prepare a customer outage list and so we're going to be looking into the customers that are being powered by you know the wires that we're replacing are going to be impacted by the work that we're doing and of the you know the most times it's commercial properties that we're concerned with as far as the outages go when residential folks usually the you the crews when they're out in the field they'll actually knock on the door when they're out there and say hey look you know we're going to be pulling off the power to replace the service and they'll let them know you know out in the field when they're out there doing the work whereas with the commercial outages they need to coordinate with the commercial customer on when is the appropriate time a lot of times that involves doing work at night and so there are charges that are going to need to be accounted for related to commercial outages so when do we need to prepare an outage list so primary risers is going to be the only situation where we're going to be including all customers on the outage list both commercial and residential and this is going to include the replacement of risers cutout bodies fuse links or splicing in c so if we're doing any sort of primary riser related make ready where we're doing those types of actions going to include all customers in our outage list both commercial and residential whereas the only the commercial customers are important when we're doing secondary or service replacements work requiring splicing that would be any underground splicing or primary or secondary when we're replacing fuse links for transformers and then transformer replacements themselves and then just to point out here like so there are going to be line cutouts where we're going to be replacing a fuse link these are going not require any outage as the crew is going to install a jumper to keep the lines energized okay so how do we determine if the customer is residential or commercial all right well got my job open here i think i had a message that popped up about me needing to refresh the design so i'm going to do that say file refresh design and while that's running okay and so what are we doing for work so on poll twenty seven and normally how i would do this is i would look at it from a page to page in my construction sketches i'm just going to go right down the line here and look at all of this stuff so poll twenty seven we're replacing services so there's a way you can go in and actually see the customer information for those service points and so you basically click on the service point itself that's the yellow square and then within that service point there's a premises child editor and that actually has the four addresses or meters associated with this it's like one eighty one one seventy nine i imagine that's probably an a and b or four one fl two kind of situation so there are four customers here associated with this particular service point and of course then you would have to go into each one and then go into special css data to then see the recom field shows are so this is just replacing a service i go back into my process document replacing a service would be only commercial customers get included on the outage list and in this case that's a residential now then i have to go to the other one the other one the other one so's that kind of takes a little too much time to do because like you could be going you know this address is going to have the same deal it's going to have four different addresses one seventy five seventy one seventy three so the best way the easiest way to at least to check to see if you're going to need to do an outage list especially when you're replacing services is figuring out which transformer is powering that those services like where's the transformer powering these services and so secondary is here i see a transformer over here so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to do a quick little trace to see what section of secondary this transformer is powering and so to do that clear i'm going to drop a trail point on the transformer going to go to nrid electric nrid electric trace and for this one i'm just going to trace out secondary and so what this does is it's just showing you that this transformer at least as far as gis is concerned is powering this entire section in red of secondary and then all of these service points the purple little squares the streetls like there's a streetlight here up until there's an open in the line which is represented by one of these ends it's a net cut or secondary open let's see if i can find one looks like there's one actually on pole twenty six so pretty sure i've shown these before but for the sake of the video the recording let's see here and i thought i had the coordinates in my oh that is not the right pole wrong job here we go there we go all right and so according to gis that net cut is on that southern span going down here and actually i believe that is a quad i believe that's coming out ofp this quad this bank here this transformer bank that's down on fort scre let's go into into preview i'm just going to drop this in to look at our poll and so to see this is just tied to okay this is the cut this is a cut for so this is a cut here for this triplex the hots stop here the neutral just continues to connect so this section of triplex i don't know why they have it going all the way over to here looks like maybe it was powering something over here before they went underground see where's the other cuts trying to find a nice example of a net cut let's see where's one because this one actually ends up really being a net cut or a cut it's really just added in gis to basically keep this section of secondary from connecting to the other side and they have that cut in here because with this this that i'm not the quad is coming from the transformer bank down here it's coming along down then it comes to our pole but it doesn't really connect to anything doesn't connect with any of the wires it basically just bolts the pole and then it continues this way across the street to our service over there let's find another cut to find a here's a good cut good look an example right there go oh there it is so this is a cut where the hot wires are basically not connecting with the rest of it and this is separate this is on a separate circuit so it looks like this particular quad is powering this power bank is powering this quad and that wire is coming out to here and kind of just dead ending it's not really going anywhere i don't know if they were trying to or planning on connecting it it seems strange to have a quad going to nothing here and so that just kind of keeps the secondaries isolated so back into gis i'm going and looking at my trace back in and electric trace and so this is the transformer that's powering our services over here we're also replacing this service i don't really see any other services that we're replacing so we're replacing one sixty five to one sixty seven one seventy one to one seventy five and one seventy nine to one eighty one we're also that's actually getting replaced on a separate one but for this particular transformer now that i know that that's the transformer that's powering these secondaries you can clear the trail go into the transformer itself and you go to specials customer detail and that will open up a window that shows us customer information now for the period i'll switch this to something with this year i try not to make it like last month because there's no information in there so i usually will go a couple months before all right and so then these are all going to be all of our addresses that are associated with that particular transformer and now we're looking for specific addresses so we're looking for commercial addresses so there are some blanks i really don't know what we do with the blanks we don't really default include them you know it's just going to be including what has the cs so looks like in one seventy one to one seventy five there's a that seventy three is there so it looks like seventy three needs to go on the outage list seventy nine needs to go on the outage list i believe that's it on those two all right and so what i'm going to do is in order to get this into that customer information into the format that i want to use in my customer outage list you need to do a directional trace so you can just drop a trailpoint on your service line go to tools electric i'm sorry n grid electric directional trace and then i'm just going to do a quick little downstream trace here and this is i mean it's going to look at the whole thing but it's really just showing us the customer information like the load on that service so this is the result and then i can take these results and export them to excel the excel that pops up is actually excel in the on the server that storms or smallw lives in so what i usually will do is i'll usually have an empty blank excel sheet andy and then i will copy this out of the cl file that was the result of the trace and paste that in here usually put the header on the bottom okay and so what do we need we need a one seventy three commercial i'm to delete these other ones and that was one trace so i download this no and so now we also got to do the other side because i know one eighty one had a service that we wanted to account for as well so let's clear the trace and then drop another trailo downstream running while that's waiting i'm going to update say pole twenty seven this is the poll that's driving the outage like so pole twenty seven granite debris and then what are we doing well we're replacing a service service there's those results again export to excel that'll open up again on so there's my local version of excel that the one there's the other doc is that it up seventy nine eighty one that's it and my local so let's see what are we got to copy out of here it looks like one commercial so i'm going to copy that and paste that in here and so now we have the commercial customers captured tied to replacing the two services on poll twenty seven and that was the extent of the make ready on that poll that was outage related it was just replacing two services and it just so happened that two of the services two of the eight services that were associated with these two service points are commercial all right so that's pole twenty seven now we're going to go up to twenty six so again what kind of work are we doing on poll twenty six so one of the things that we're doing is we're replacing a fuse link but this is one of those line cutouts that that process doc was referring to this is a considered a line cutout and so a lot of times you'll find these like you know on the tap like this and if they do an outage then all of the potential customers associated downstream from that pack could potentially be an outage so that's why what they'll do is instead of doing an outage they add on these jumpers to you know basically keep power flowing so they're able to work on the cutout replace those fuse links without you know taking customers offline so this line cutout is this bad boy and so we don't need to worry about that from an outage perspective so really the only thing i'm worried about here is going to be this quad service which goes to seventy six gener only quads are going to power customers that are commercial or larger drawers or power looks like this one has five all one seventy six so let's see let me go back in and i'm going drop a trail i'm going to go and do the electric trace trace do it downstream that will give us all of the results associated with that service to one seventy six and in our results there all three of the ones that have a res com listed are commercial i'm going to select all of those export to excel it just keeps exporting to the same filecel okay theres one seventy six granite and basically all but this one i'm just going to copy that control c come back in here and going to paste that in also going to insert a row above there two and then do the same thing here poull twenty six granite three poull and what is driving the outage in this case we're replacing a service placing suraceld rid of that final one right looks like i need to probably make some more room down here for additional outage item doert and so that was it on this particular one from an outage standpoint moving on to the this next one now i didn't particularly remember which this transformer actually powered all of the customers and i couldn't remember if one sixty seven one sixty five to one sixty seven were commercial or residential i'm just going to go in and drop my trail point electric directional i do like running traces it's kind of fun downstream two addresses and one is final and then one is residential so we don't have to worry about that now also with this poll poull twenty five if i go into my description of work we are replacing a transformer related actually in this case we're replacing the cutouts and the transformer fuse linkgths as well so what we need to do is we need to also include any commercial customers not already accounted for by these replacements of the services so we go back into the customer data for this particular transformer and so basically any of these other commercial ones that we hadn't accounted for in our outage list already will need to be accounted for here because what we're doing is we're replacing the fuse linkgth so they're going to have to cut power to that transformer and therefore it will impact the customers downstream we've already covered one seventy nine one seventy three earlier in our outage list so the only thing that we have left here is this one forty one arena bed here so one forty one granite where's one forty one one that it that's one thirty eight to one forty eight it must be on the other side of the road here or there's one forty one so what i'm going to do is i'm going same deal going to drop a trail even though this we're not doing any work on pole twenty three we're not we don't have any work that we're doing on pole twenty three but because we're replacing the fuse link in the cutouts on the transformer that's powering that service we'll need to add that to the outage list drop the trail and grid electric directional downstream there's our customer one forty one export to excel and there is our commercial customer i go back into my outage list and do pole twenty five granite i think this one was five ye so twenty five granite street for the work that's driving this outage it's just replace here one in okay and i think we have one more pole to look at here so we did twenty five add the transformer the other ones two more poles that i have to look at okay so pole twenty two see what this construction sketch so poull twenty two the layout open already so why that's all the way down like that hope i didn't already export my sketches so pole twenty two involve the primary riser okay we're not really accorting to that cheat sheet here not really replacing the riser we're not replacing the cutouts we are not replacing fuse links but we are splicing in cable and that's why i ended up in my gis design ended up splitting the underground primary and then replacing a section of it to get that material now you' get my comeb back and say hey you don't actually need to splice it because the outage might be just way too much so because it's a primary riser any of the customers powered downstream from this primary riser is going to be impacted by this outage so let's see how many customers there are because it's a this building a pretty big building and there's there's that primary riser here that we're working on so let's see clear my trail i'm going to drop a trail on the primary riser u guard i mean the primary underground conductor there electric race directional downstream now we'll see how much of an outage this thing is going to be oh that's it only three customers well they're all commercial though so we're going select those export to excel come back in here and i'm going to do pull twenty two granite street and what are we doing we are splicing in cablelicing in cable that bold open up the excel that cancel grab those records we see those records here awesome and then last but not least we have a pole replacement with fuse links that we are likely replacing whenever we do a pole replacement with a transformer we're usually either going if the cutouts were porcelain we would replace them with non porcelain and then we're always going to be replacing the fuse links which will drive potential outages now i'm going to just do a customer look for this transformer actually let's try something else let's try to do a downstream trace on the transformer and see if that gives us the results that i want instead of doing an individual trace on each individual service there electric directional downstream it populates with because both of these service points that we're seeing here are well i know one of them is empty there is no premise associated with it and the other is actually associated with a traffic signal at this intersection here there's two risers and it's likely this new one is power in this box here which is then in turn doing something with these lights i know there's also another riser on the backide of this pole that's kind of hard to see where there's a wire that hangs down loosely here comes off a secondary hangs down they have it attached to the pole and then it loops around the other side on the back so when we replace the fuse links it's going to cut power to these services these underground or riser they're actually really just mi lights the work associated with this you we're only going to do from a national grid perspective is like the reconnect of the leads to the secondary when we raise it but because we're replacing the fuse link that is going to take out any of the customers associated with this transformer what did the trace come back with oh cool it gives me all of secondary way beyond all of the net cuts that didn't really help me all that much give me way too many customers twenty one hundred customers that would have been a heck of an outage list all right so let's just go into the transformer itself and see what customers are being powered by this transformer c we're going to go into i had it beforeer customer detail and then i'm going to go down to a more recent date make sure i'm capturing any of the other extra services here and it looks like there are three customers one twenty five which is associated with the signal the traffic signal that's city of quincy we have dunkin' donuts it looks like at one hundred over here and then we have star market one thirty here so those are going to be our three customers that we're going to need to add to the outage list now of course this doesn't have any of the doesn't have all the fields that we need to create the outage list so we're going to need to do a couple downstream traces to get this information in there now i mentioned before there's two service points here i know this one has no premise it's just added to in order to show the riser that's there there's a couple risers that are hiding behind the scenes here and those are tied to these mi lights so one of these premises i one of these service points doesn't have a premise this one does this one has the actual address information so going to do a trace on that and do and grid electric directional and then downstream and it' really just get it into that format that we want it in the outage list export to excel while i'm in here waiting for that to export i will add a couple more fields and this is one holdenty it three and we're replacing fiews l here one of the addresses's this one right that takes care of this one one thirty directional trace downstream export to excel copy paste and then the last one was this one spread electric directional downstream export to excel copy pasteld set with close all of those app so now we've accounted for all the customers that are being powered by that transformer at least how gis is showing it sometimes there'll be ones that aren't accounted for that they'll pick up when we do our when the revisions come they always manage to find services that i didn't find so not a problem if that does end up being the case so for this list i'm going to file save as go into my local folder for this job which is ran it and then i'm just going to call this customer outage list work order number three one two one five six five three i'll take care of that now in storms for the outage requirement it's added through this optional requirements button that'll open up this window where you'll go down to find the six fifty five requirement you'll select that and just add it you don't need to assign it to anyone you don't need to put your name in there or anything like that just leaves it just like that and obviously we'll upload the outage document you know when we're ready to finalize the job and get those all the docs uploaded to storms generally i'll do all that at the end so that's going to wrap up my presentation for doing a customer outage list going to stop recording

VIDEO_ID: WorkingThroughGIS_Design Part 2.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] alighty so i was just running through this application that i'm writing the work order for this is not the same one that we were looking at before launch but this just just came up this is a one pole application where we're calling to install a new anchor and a couple down guys this is a delta system type there is no system neutral as you can see looking at the pole this pole eight here no system neutral no triplex nothing and so if i we went into the a document to determine whether it was capital or maintenance capital work raising lowering replacing or installing span guys or down guys on a y feeder because there's a bond required the down guy would get bonded to neutral well this one there is no system neutral so it's actually a delta so it really should be a yammo and that's what i went through i progressed a yammo problem is that the cost units still came through as capital cost units so let's see take a second here so let's go back into that poll right so so we to we were able to run through some tricks to get the down guys to actually show up as maintenance hence the m at the end of the cu but the anchor is still capital apparently so this job probably should have been yammo which you know we didn't apparently de anchor is considered capital in new england but not in new york so this work order number is no longer valid we can't use this to progress the job because when i went to send estimates to storms or rather yep there it is errors have been found and it's telling me that cost unit anchor three one oh two is a capital cu on a yammo job and so we're not going to be able to actually complete this job in gis with that particular cu but that's what we need to progress the job so i'm kind of stuck so i got to stop this job i'm going to have to basically create a pstipia work order number for the job resend it to gis i don't have to do the file alternative part again because i've already done the gis edits and then so once it's been sent to gis i can again start this over again but with the new work order number so this is kind of a weird one where the anchor actually turned out to be capital but the down guides were not yamos are kind of a pain in the neck because things like this happen but i just kind of wanted to point just talk about a little bit about what i had just run into with this job i almost assigned this to someone and then i was like i don't know a brand new anchor install that's kind of tricky and so i just assigned it to myself and now look at me i've created a mess here so or there is a mess here so going put the breakkes on that u let's see no undo the less and continue this fine all right i'm going to stop sharing i'm going to reshare my other screen because i want to be on the big screens in the twenty four inch screen i think john has like this mon is it john or josh has like this monster screen that they're using all right so le we left off on that pole replacement where i was looking at tree trimming and that was and i can't stand when this happens file now you select everything view and then i'm going to unfreeze panes because i can't stand when everything's frozen like that so we've already looked at this pole replacement and now it's this one that we're looking at gis five five three nine it's going to be the last four of our work order number and it's still in here my recent projects this is going to open up one of those messages that say hey there might be conflicting data consider refreshing the answer is going to be okay and we'll go to file refresh design that's figuring out what it wants to do's going to grab the coordinates out of my e five and drop those into oh hey they're already there that's right with the giant tree that's not actually there anymore so okay that completed so let's go to this pole o i was already there allight so now we got to go and look at our rear world objects in this case it's the pole the down guy and a service those are the three objects that we're going to replace as rear world objects and then we're going to auto generate cost units and then add and modify tost units so pole is first and what are we setting here we're doing a forty five two good editor and we're going to set this to a forty five let's set this one to a two that's not a two two and i'll fix butts with that after note that the buttons are not grayed out so we're working in our gis design so then i'm going to come in here and go replace who's removing the old pole well that's going to be telephone while i have the replace version of the pole up i'm going to make sure that i change the setb by from telephoneop time out what the heck i don't know what that is going set the setb by to electric the national engir is going to be setting the new pole and then on the backide the telephone for the removal so that's good that takes care of the pole replacement now i'm going to replace the service and i don't think we've run into a service replacement on any of our training i think i we had one on i to say maybe john's job and maybe ivan's job but so here we have a service remember services run from the pole or the span somewhere to whatever is drawing on that power in this case it's number forty nine and so the existing size is a four we replace number four services with number two so i'm going to go from four i'm going to change this to a two now we'll leave the material as aluminum that's fine it is triplex meaning that it has's made of three wires two hots and one neutral leg leave that as is and then for the insallation we're going to install pe for the covering and so pretty much your number four services will be replaced with twos and then you know we'll update the insallation usually twos will be replaced with twos sometimes you'll run into services that are oneaught oftentimes associated with buildings where there are it's four or more heaters we'll have a larger slash pplex and then i mean you'll even have up to three thirty six sometimes for secondary size depending on the customer all right so we got the two in the pe got my little deltas come in here and hit the replace button and that creates i like to get rid of the ano i don't i think it just takes up space on my sketches so i'm just going to select that and go to service ano and remove it the last piece here is going to be the down guun okay which thought i updated the did i not do it thought i did a dis that up there i' have to come back to that update that after all right so we're going update we're going to replace the primary down guy here could be that i just never actually because i did i check so i'm going to replace the primary down guy awesome i've replaced my real world objects for this poll and now i'm going to come in here i'm going to do point span editor generate work records create new going to create two work point flags one for the service replacement and one for the poll itself select both of these right click expand to see all my cost units so normally i would start with the service first with this because i'm just going to confirm that the auto generated cost units actually populated that there's no undefined or no detail cost units like this this will prevent your job from design completing so with the services just going to make sure that there's nothing like that in there with no details or undefined so just going to minimize those two also going to minimize the service connection service related cus within four point five because there's something there really care what it is as long as it's not an undefined services generally will auto generate how we want them to be the service is done so i can minimize four and then i'm just going to do what i did with the last poll we're going to go to poll to handle the poll removal now instead of having to hunt for the cuto top i have the favorites tab but there's also a design tab here we will actually list all your cost units that you've added to a job to your job at this point so we've already added the cuto top it's right there so i can just go in and apply from here also if you know when i right clicked on any of the cost units in here you can actually add to your favorites from here so maybe you have a job with a ton of cus and you want to and some of them are ones that you want to add to your favorites you can just go into your job go into the design tab under the c selector and just start selecting costumits right click add to favorites you know and then i've kind of added folders and all kinds of fun stuff i'll equal lot of the cost units that i'm using on the regular all right so design cut off top every pole replacement going to be cutting off the pole top right and so that handles the removal folder we're going to go into the poll install folder now this one for whatever reason has the dash jo associated with it we want to get rid of that so we're going to actually replace this costumit with a forty five two but without the dash jo so we're going to go you could select it and do the replace or you can right click in the white space add all right and so i'm looking for a forty five so i'm just going to put in the description here forty five narrow down my result to just looking at forty five pos and so now we need a forty five two this one hit okay all right and so now that just adds that poll cost unit for a forty five two i'm going to wr cloop got to reselect that poll folder the edit and then we're going go in and add the co right and this is where i'm going go into my favorites and just add those silly little cost units that we have to add well same old set is pretty big or big one every pole replacement's going have the same w set in the install folder and then everyone's also going to have pwrw and i really wish there was a select bunch of records and add or a way to shut off this silly message that pops up every single time this one this is just going pop up every time you add a cost unit so pw rw pp two zero pnwp for the pole numbering wood pse and then what is our poll number i believe it was twenty five i think it was hey twenty five we're going add two and five awesome so we have our poll same whole set the silly little cus associated with stenciling and reflectors and all that fun stuff note that all of those come in as capital cccccc so the pole install is all set going minimize that and i'll minimize the old one two all right pole top configuration so sign is calling for nine dash four one two and if i'm going to look in street view here it does have the double cross arm crossing the road that's what i'm going go with the nine dash four one two now what auto generated here let's find out nine dash four thirteen a note that there was not a cl at the end which implies that this is not covered wire primary so we're going to go in just double check on that so primary you go to primary wires and the installation is bare if this was tww or pe but my session timed outing how my session times out when i'm in there working that's irritating i wonder if it's because i've been in it since probably four o'clock four thirty this morning well i'm to go and try to get back into my gis here so let's see i hope that brings me back to where i was before small world is pretty good about when you get kicked out then get back in that you kind of it opens gis right back up to where you left off i do remember with arcgis back in those days with working with arcgis did anyone else work with arcgis i mean did you guys work with gis in previous jobs or in school or and if so did you work with arcgis this is my first time it's all new to me all new to you when i was in college wasn't even a minor it was just a certificate certificate in gis but that was using arcgis which is a more widely used software suite so i know that small world is very popular in the utilities which is what we're using now i had no small world experience coming into this job so i've just gained all of this within just the time working here and you know as a person that likes gis it's nice to be able to try different softwares but all right login back in to gis yeah sure load all my applications that it just kicked me out of and of course i got to do the i'll type in my password thing several times that's not the password that is the password and then he look at that right where we left off storms all right so everyone can see my screen once again cool all right going back in and so now i'm going to swap out these nine dash four thirteen a' for the nine dash four one two a now i believe that we already have one of those in my favorites or in my design i click add co go to design and sure enough there is one already there and i'm going to install remove and to get rid of the four thirteen and primary was four ought that's really big so the cost unit we have here the two to four oug for the transfer of primary cover it now one thing i do want to double check these are just okay minimize that all right going move on to the guying so anchoring guy is just tied to the anchor that's my no detail that's my undefined i'm just going to delete that because we're not really transferring there's no real cost to account for with that now we're going we have like cu tied to removing the existing down guy that's good and we have a cu tied to installing the new one so that's good what we got left we got looks like secondary we got two folders that was created for secondary and that's because we actually have you know the through secondary and we also have a tap here so let's look at this so the tap is actually coming right off of the pole itself and it looks like it's jumper down here so that's not really that looks like it's the best view so we got the through bracket but the slight angle heading over here with the guy checking out i don't know if that he's getting his mail or i do love spying on people in f field like he might be looking at his mail but ye so that cap is coming off of the pole directly and then we have the span that's running down the roadway and what does the e five show the e five shows transfer secondary now what i'm actually going to do is i'm going to modify the description of work here a bit because this doesn't take into account the fact that there's the tap it's just basically account in the fact that there's through secondary here but not this tab here so what am i going to do all i'm going to do is go to transfer secondary let's how about we do this transfer through secondary and tap and then for the standard i'm going to change this from ten dash one hundred fig two to ten dash one oh one fig four and open up my excel sheet go to the secondary brackets here and so ten d one oh one fig four covers dead end secondary tap with a through and so actually i've got in the process document for writing work orders here let's go to the play this in process documents here so we're going to go into the make ready work order process doc guys all have and go into the view navigation pane and then i added there's a cost units and make ready example section that's under construction but i did add recently a section tied to the secondary brackets with images that show you from the standards manual what it would look like but the standard is what it covers so on and so forth and then there's actually some other instructions in here so we're going down to the per stap which is the ten dash one oh one fig four and so this is what's going on on the pole we have through secondary continuing on and then there's a tap with its own bolt on the pole and that's what we have here the tap is actually looks like above the triplex a bit but it's a similar setup except reversed it's going the other direction that's how we're going to call this one we're going to call this a ten dash one oh one fig four and so what we need to do is the cu this particular cu only covers the tap portion so we're going to have to add a cost unit for that through portion here and that's going to be either the prst the prst two a or the prissa two so the original standard here was a ten dash one hundred fig two which is just a through bracket up to i think ten degrees so coming back into here i'm going to just use this secondary conductor folder that already has triplex in it and i'm going to open that up and so we're already accounting for well that's the prisa which auto generated and that is ten dash one hundred fig three for corners it's not really a corner this is kind of what the corner pole would look like so that didn't really autoenate correctly i'm going to add in the per stap cost unit here and that's in my favorites i'm going to do it install and removal here iied to that tap okay i'm going to delete these two because they don't need them and then i'm going to increase the quantity of the triplex from one to two one of those covers the through secondary transfer and one of those covers the tap and they're in separate folders i mean there's no sense of me moving these two up to there ones we're covered we should be good here so we're replacing the through brackets and we're replacing the tap and then we're transferring the two conductors and i believe that was it on this pole tap add splices to extend secondary tap as necessary okay so there was my splices related to adding in the additional material to extend secondary to i'm tired of blurry bit so we'll go back ten years so we're raising this pole up and i thought that they might have needed additional material does kind of look like they've got a lot a lot of slack in that line already i mean i guess it's being pulled down by that tree branch and i mean it's about the same size pole between the views so i'm still going to go in and add it anyways just in case so we're going to do to add in the splicing go into my cu list secondary splicing and it actually has some explanations on the differences between duplex triplex and quad i mentioned before that triplex has two hots and one neutral leg duplex which is usually you'll see that sometimes with just powering streetls is usually one hot one neutral and then the quad replex is three hot wires and one neutral so for the hot legs we're going to need this cost unit and for the neutral we're going to need this one and the way that i remember it in my mind is that the hot legs for triplex we need two and that the number two is in there and for the neutral we need one and the one is in that one is in the cu so that's how i keep them straight in my mind so i'm going copy that and go secondary conductor now this splicing that we're calling to do will likely result in a potential outage associated with number fifty eight if number fifty eight was a commercial business i don't know what fifty eight is even powering at this point it looks like an empty lot oh wait there it is it's like it's probably okay so the poles there and so it's probably powering this house over here going underground over there probably not a commercial business a commercial property for starter let's the add the cost units first so here's the hot leg splicing and i'm just going to add and apply and install one of those and then i'm going to go back to my list there and piece this in and apply add one of those i'm going to come back into my list here i'm going to change the hot legs from quantity of one to two lock in those updates and then while i'm here going' double check number fifty eight just to see if it's listed as commercial it's huge house so it's probably not so i'm just going into the service point and then the premise data and the css data to drill down into the res designation so that's residential so no outage there and might as well check forty nine while we're here because going have to check eventually premise service point dss same deal there residential so i'm going to add some notes to my a five no outage needed for either services now i also added here basically it's just the description of work or the pole location for my dig safe so i was there in google maps i just noted what side of the road it was on and what was the nearest street because that's usually information that i would have to go replug in the coordinates for when i was going through and doing my dig safe so that was just a little extra note that i added to added for myself next one have this the next pole it probably should save before it picks me out next pole would work is we're installing u guard we're doing a foam seal and we're doing a drip reduced drip to drip loop to within within six inches of riser i'm going to go into the cords say that actually there it is so what we got there's the guy checking his mail fun got a nice back to back dead end on our cross arm so if we were replacing this pole and transferring primary we would actually account for six transfers rather than the three because the primary wires are dead ending on the crossarm that's just something to point out there but so for this one we're just doing the riser u guard spray foam and reducing the drip loop associated with probably this and it looks like the riser is on this side of the polep now i did notice some vegetation some vines here at the base of the pole like that riser still comes up up to there even though it's getting out whited out that's all we're doing for work so yeah i did note that there was some trimming that needed to be done in order for them to get in there and do what they need to do with the riser they're going to probably have to trim some of these vines it's not really considered tree trimming it's just brush clearing or vine trimming and it's usually something that can be handled by the crews on the truck rather than having an arborist go out in the field to actually look at tree trimming so on my e five here i just noted wrong at the e five i noted just brush clearing was required there and that was just primarily tied to dealing with this potential de vines that have taken over my pole again i'm also looking at this in twenty nineteen i mean vines are weeds have a way of growing really fast so who knows what this pole actually is going to look like now with all of those vines but it impacts the work potentially now if we were just we'll say replacing the service that's going off into the trees over there we wouldn't have to really worry about the vine trimming because it does not impact our work we're only really calling for the tree trimming or the brush clearing if it's going to impact our work all right so i'm going to actually select the riser folder rather than the pole and the reason why is that the spray foam riser cost unit must be in a riser folder otherwise gis is going to throw an error so we're just going to add all of the cost units in that riser folder for ease here i have the pole selected i'm going to go in to the point span editor i'm going to add my worko flag i still have that riser selected i'm going to do the associate via map editor which will give me access to the riser object and cl list and now for the uuard go back into my cu list okay so one of these is going to be the uuard we're going to be using the four inch uuard is actually going to come in five foot sections so we'll only need eighteen inches of u guard so we would only need one of these now if we needed more than sixty inches of uuard then we would just increase the quantity up they just come in five foot sections so let's got to be aware of that so i'm just going to grab the four inch one paste that into the here uncheck group install that there's our uuard going to go back into my list here i close this going to open that and it's not what i need there's your spray foam cost unit not there's a note here it says must be added to a riser folder so cuf pen i go and search for it install that and then for the last piece of work on this pole it's reducing that drip loop and so our first pole had a drip loop but that was a associated with a transformer there's the reduce drip loop so we used this one the last time because there was a transformer and what needed to be trimmed were the leads associated with the transformer this particular pole no transformer we're just going to use the other one which is the services labor adder to cut drip loop and then reconnect i'm going to paste that in there there's really not much of anything difference wise between the two so sometimes they are used kind of interchangeably so sometimes we'll also get engineers that are really picky that will actually ask us to swap out this one for the transformer one or whatnot so it's not a bad habit just to get in the habit of adding the one that actually fits for the situation that one pole is benit though and looks like my last pole would work that's right this was a push brace pole go to coordinates i can find my ready okay there's our service that's being replaced assuming service is being replaced across the street and i think i've noted for tree trimming because that wire goes right through that tree get to the house note the push brace here they probably weren't unable to guy in the way that they needed so they use the push brace i don't i don't see anything that's pulling the pole in this direction that would warrant the push brace though it is a dead end three phase primary dead ending here and then it's going to a single phase primary you can see the three wires hitting the cross arm and then only one wire continuing down the line and you can see that in gis as such so you get your three lines here and then one comes out the other end now what else is here we got cut out one cutout here and there which we see in gis that's our cutout a link cut out and then also we have lightning arresters one two three which it looks like i probably should have added those lightning arresters in as well i'm going go in and make a note to redo edits here as well add three las that file alternative and then i also have to do update the lead update anchor guy stuff in pl my notes okay and so what we're doing for work here is we are raising secondary considerably and then replacing a service like i said the service going across the street curious how that service is coming off is it attached to the pole is it bolted to the pole or is it coming off of theote un mid span and it looks like it's coming off of the wire in the span not bolted to the pole so the service standard probably is an eleven dash one one five which it is that's the standard for services coming off of the span somewhere whereas if it was coming off of the pole it would probably be a dead end on the pole and we would probably just replace this eleven dash one one five with a ten dash one oh one fig five all right and you notice here there's a cut here a net cut is that a cut it looks like there might be a cut there as well go back in look at that again but all right let's replace the surface now the surface is already a number two but we still need to replace it because we want to make sure that there's enough material in the line to account for the fact that we're raising secondary almost fifty inches here apparently now there is a streetight on this pole which gives me pause that's a problem the streetl on the well before i get too crazy with this let's just make sure the streetlight is actually there in lci i mean i see it in the note here going to go into lci we have not actually talked about streetlights which is great that we've run into one like this what poll are we looking at here remember right sixty four designty four i what measure load and so glad i nope streetlight still there okay so streetlights may or may not be owned and maintained by national grid so sometimes the cities and towns will actually buy the streetlights off of national grid and then the city town ends up becoming the responsible party associated with dealing with the streetlight work okay but there's just no way looking at the e five here there's no way that you're going to raise triplex fifty two inches with that streetlight there there's no way unless they you know pull out this wire like detach it pull it all the way out to get over the streetlight to get it to come back over there they ain't going to do that they got to remove the streetight and raise that up as well or no remove it raise the wire and then maybe reattach it i don't know if they're going to need to set it at a certain spot for clearances but this was a miss on design because this needs to be accounted for either here because it's owned and maintained by national grid or in a separate column on the e five with the additional communication lines to be dealt with by the city or town all so how do we figure out the ownership on the streetlights so to do that we're going to go into the work order resources and we'll probably go over this again tomorrow or another day where we're all here because this hasn't come up yet and this is something that eventually as we get more comfortable we'll be able to notice type things like this that are not accounted for and be able to do something with it so streetlight there is under the work order resources folder a streetlight ownership ne in new york we're going to go into the ne right and of course there's lots of different files in here i got to probably go in and archive some of these let's see here move those what's that one that one is really dated we'll leave the rhode island ones in there i'm just going to drop those into the archive folder just so that's not confusing when you get in there i think it's this one the contact list thing okay so this isre the correct list and it looks like this it is updated periodically and so every town on this list owns and maintains their own streetlights okay lennox is not in this list lenox okay so that means that the streetlights are owned and maintained by national grid so having a streetlight height in this column is good now if these lights were actually owned by the town of lenox that we'd have the designer go back in and add there's already a municipal streetlights section on the e five so why is there a the heck is that and why is it in the municipal streetl column going to have to look into that let's see here what happens with work order me i just fall down rabbit holes left them right let's see here what is it that we're okay so yeah this is a that makes sense so this is probably a town owned light associated with the school yeah the school zone and so what they have noted here is this riser that the weatheread with the power coming from secondary powering this little box and then going underground to then power this flashing light so that would be town oh maintained that's good that explains why that's there i might just add this school signal and let's see where's the d home wrap there we go all right so if lenox owned maintain the streetlights all the streetight heights would be in these columns well in this column under existing height and then any of the additional work that needed to be performed by those streetlight work needed to be addressed in this column so since streetlights so this pole replacement also looks like it needs streetlight stuff think i addressed any of that right i missed that in my gis design and pole thirty five doesn't even show a street light what on earth oh wait that's secondary drip loop not streetlight so no streetight there okay so we're back to our streetlight pole so we're missing make ready here and so we need to reach out to the designer i need to reach out to the designer to find out you know what it is that we need to do with the streetlight stuff now i can still move forward with doing what we have listed here because what we're going to do with the streetlight is not a real world object i have to replace it so i don't have to worry about like generating cost units we'll need to have to go back in and redo them so let's go in and deal with what we got here and then i will throw together a email to to the designer and i'm assuming qc about this all right so we're replacing the service to four nineteen and this was a number two and we're just going to replace that with itself just going to do replace we don't have to update anything in the attributes got for number two we've got the al and we got the pe for the installation already right so we're going to hit replace yes and i like to get rid of the ano thing there's our light i'm also going to come in here now and generate work records that was the only real world object that i needed to deal with create new we create the two worko flags looks like i have the removal anod still there i'm going to get rid of that butters up the sketches seven and eight im to select both of those expand so all that auto generated right now where a cost unit tied to that service that we replaced it replaced it oh my god i can't talk so we're going to minimize those because just confirming that there's node donendefines now we have to go into the pole itself we'm going to select worko flag eight and then associate via map selection to open up the poll folder and that's where we're going to add the cost units tied to raising secondary with that standard and so we're just going to go into my favorites because i have all of these cost units already in my design or no my design because i have them already there so we have the triplex transfer then i'm also going to do the install and remove of the prsts so this one so install and remove that ruby okay and we're set with this well i'm going to hit save okay everyone' still awake eliate awesome allighty so what am i going to do now going to reopen that gis design and i'm going to hit the save button if i haven't already i did so now i need to figure out how to who do i need to get in touch with who do i need to get in touch with to add this additional make ready i'm to go back into helix and get out of that all right and so this is lenux and it looks like dao was the designer and looks like nick was the qc so i'm going to have to send an email to both of them okay and nick and i'm going to cc petty and i'm going to cc pickup and then for the title i'm going to say additional might even i'm going to have cc everyone in this email as well let's see megan cc josh john and ivan awesome additional make ready needed on i'm just going to say priority application gateway six and i'm just going to copy and paste in the work order number here i don't know i am a two finger typer i folks actually type with all their fingers or but i mastered the two finger method for typing so i'm over here bang it away at my keyboard so let's see here ready need an application so good afternoon while course i can well reviewing the work order for order application referenced and subject l it looks like we're going to need additional make ready for one of the polls with a secondary raise okay and then i'm going to reference the e five i'm going to say that i always like to include the item number as well whenever i'm talking about specific polls so i'm going to say item thirty eight poll sixty four item thirty eight full sixty four that walker road grab those coordinates so that way it's pretty easy to get there if someone wants to i'm already in it am i all right and then we'll come over here so double check that okay so going grab those coordinates going to put those in my email as well see i'll do a screenshot as well and what i'm going to do i just do a snip of this tool there it is all right let's go back into here so we're propose to raise secondary fifty what was that fifty eight inches here fifty two supposeing ra secondary fifty two inches here but there's no way that we're going to be able to accomplish that without removing and reattaching the street light which ised maintained by and grid not sure if we assuming we can probably just leave it at the same height but see just need to detach re catch here or if there's additional make ready beyond that please add vise note that this work order is do eleven twenty sixvy now nick is out i don't know i think i'm going to probably cc m as well plus tim double check nick's calendar and see when he's going if he's out or okay offline go into the calendar here for him all saturday the sixteenth to the november seventeenth through the twenty first so he's been out this week be so he's out this week it looks like as nick appears to be this week and then the last thing i'm to do here is going to add my working e five because one of the things that ends up happening is that we're going to go into these work orders and we might make some changes and we're going to update you know maybe a poull top configuration or maybe we're missing some make ready and we've made all those changes kind of on the fly in work order well if we send the job back to design to revise they'll probably be updating their own work their own e five and so then we end up with their e five with their changes and then our e five with the changes that we made and you know it's hard to make sure that everything lines up so a lot of times what i'll do to make sure that changes get made to my working e five i will include that in my email of course i can't if i have it open drag that into my email please make any required changes to my working e five attached on the path forward all right and that's what i got and then i'm going to then go into helix and i am going to go in and add a note just basically saying that might as well grab that email that i just sent just so i can have it for reference sent all right and so item thirty eight poll sixty four so e design qc about missing street make ready on which is required in order to rarise secondaryesome so yeah that's kind of fun and i'm kind of done with this i've done all of the polls except for the streetl work i need to go back in and probably my do another file alternative just to grab those and address those few things that looks like i missed previously but i'm going to stop the recording now and transcribe stop recording and

TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] nice we're going go over to something from close guard for now just like talking about some positions of how to attack from close guard because sometimes like we're told a lot that close guard is a good position but when you're just starting or even when you've been training for a long time like it feels like sometimes it's hard to actually set anything up against a guy who has a good base and' defending properly so there's a couple key rules you to follow when you're playing close guard the very first one is there's like a center area of control which is inside of both of our arms and he's going always be trying to keep his hands inside of my arms i'm going always be trying to keep my hands inside of his arms okay so whoever has the inside control is going to be in the dominant position if he has the inside control and the inside it's just like this imaginary box right and it's just whoever's arms are on the inside of the other person's arms is going to be the one dictating the pace of the match and the one who's attacking so you can see he has his grips right here he's the dominant one right now from close guard my job is to break his grips and bring my hands on the inside so i can start setitting on grips of my own okay so a really good solid go to is just whichever hand is on top the one closest to your upper body is the one you want to break first there's a couple ways to do it like you can just grab his wrist and just bring it straight up to break the grip you don't want to push down because his grip is going to be strong there you always want to go towards the opening of his hand like if his hand is gripping the ge like this you need to break it that way out towards the fingertips always if you're trying to go against that like he's going to be strong but if you bring it out towards the fingertips it's going to break a lot easier okay a tricky thing you can kind of do is grab with one hand and bring your other hand onto your own wrist so that when you break the grip your hand is inside already and it's going to be in a good position to bring his posture back down so you break the grip i like to break it like this bring my hand on the inside you can bring it through here to make sure you can't just weave his hand right back in and my goal now is to try and get inside control and break his posture so i sort of keep my hand here just to block in case he tries to swing his hand back in and i'm going grab his collar and now you'll notice as i do that i'm grabbing his collar and i'm pulling my knees forward bringing my knees close to break his posture here so i'm using my hand and my legs your legs are very important here if you're just trying to grab the guy and pull him down like this with your arm your one arm iss not going to be stronger than his whole back and his solid base here so all you're going do is breaking the grip grabb it i'm going sort of reach to his tricep as well to help you pull him down here okay from here you want to maintain the posture you've broken on him one way to do that is to make sure that you adjust your hips just a little off to the side okay this is actually very important and at first it doesn't seem like it would be but what it does is it brings my leg on top of his back so now the weight of my leg is pinching down on his back so even if if i didn't have any grips at all when he tries to posture up my leg is here to just help keep him down a little bit more okay that's one thing that a lot of people when they play the closed guard they forget about if you're here like this look there's no pressure from my legs on his upper back to keep him down so i'm not using my legs efficiently in this position so whenever you have someone in closed guard and you actually manag to break their posture you want to adjust your hips and it's okay to open your guard for a second because if his posture is broken opening your guard for a second he's not going to be able to pass just enough to plant your foot do a shrimp right and use your knee on top of his back i'm going try to bring your hand to the middle of his back here like this okay so from here i'm controlling like this now he's going be trying to regain his posture how's he going to do that probably by trying to bring his hand and get that grip back on the collar getting his inside control back okay so once you break the guy's grip and you have him here your left hand is sort of just blocking his arm if you can do whatever it wants right now my right hand is still on the collar threatening chokes making sure i keep his posture broken you can always count on the guy trying to bring his hand back to your chest okay so if you know what he's going do before he does it it makes it a lot easier to come up with a counter or come up with a counter attack right really he doesn't really have any other option if you post this hand out on the mat to try and posture up he's leaving himself open for triangle chokes and other stuff so most of the times they're going to keep that elbow in tight so really his only option here is to try and weave his hand onto your chest okay so you can count this most of the time when this happens all you're going to do is grab it with your cross grip and pull it across your body here like this okay now from here my left hand is going to the opposite lat his latissimus doorside right here okay you grip that because now once his hands on the inside he's starting to feel that he's in danger i might be able to go to his back there's a lot of things i can do i'm going to keep my hand on the sleeve here and as he tries to posture up to take himself out of danger he wants to get his elbow back across my hip right so he can keep himself out of danger i'm going to keep this as he postures up i'm going bring myself in underneath him like i'm trying to set up an arm bar okay so i'm hooking here bringing him on top of me okay i use the analogy of like i'm trying to be like a medicine ball like one of those big bouncy yoga balls you want to use your weight to bring all his weight on top of you and here's the yoga ball now your goal is to bounce him up and off that way okay so this works because as he tries to bring his posture up here i'm hanging on him and you can build a lot of momentum because he doesn't have anything to base with because we grabed his sleeve earlier if i didn't have his sleeve and i tried to do this he's just going to base with that hand okay so it's important you have the sleeve grip the lat here when he tries to posture up i'm just going to pull and swing my leg see how my leg swings i'm using that to build momentum and then once i'm here his arm is trapped in between both our chests you can underhook his leg and sweep him right over okay so that's the swing but what's important is the setup the sweep is easy if you've seen it before if you've done it before that's easy the important part is getting to that position properly so that he can't just basee so again i break the grip hand on the inside hand goes to the collar both knees come in i open my guard just bring my knee over his back very key detail having your knee over his back you'll make your clothes guard a lot stronger from here he's vulnerable to triangles and stuff so he's going to try to weak this hand in when you bring that hand in i grip the sleeve it's okay if he gets my collar too this is okay i just need to make sure that i'm forcing his arm across even if he maintains the grip as long as i force his arm across here he's going to be vulnerable because he's not going to be able to base with that hand so once he's here he's going to start to try and posture up i'm going to bring his weight on top under hooking the leg you'll see his arms trapped here in between us and then this leg sweeps down if you just go right here he's going to land on your leg and i'm gonna come up on top so when you do the sweep you swing your leg and you want to chop it down underneath him see how i came out to the other side that's a difficult thing for some people you always want to make sure you do that and then you end up right in mount really solid position this is one of those sweeps that works from white belt to black belt if you can do it right last time break the grip this hand' just blocking grab the collar break the posture adjust the hips here we're just threatening him we're in a safe position he can't do anything we can threaten chokes start to thowen triangles and patas so he has to respect that to defend that he needs to bring his arm in when he bring his arm in i grab his sleeve it doesn't matter if you pull it all the way across obviously all the way across is better but you can keep it there it's just fine i'm trying to tuck his elbow in between us here now as he postures up i can reach underneath his leg and pull his weight on top of me see all his weight's on my leg right now nothing his knees aren't on the mat look it's like a magic trick it's a levitating okay all his weight is on my thigh as i swing my leg that allows me to sweep him over pretty effortlessly okay any questions on that all right let's try it guys

VIDEO_ID: Work Order Training - Day 3 Part2 (Documents).mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] morning has started all right here we go so next up on our list for documentation so to recap we've already looked at the dig safe we looked at the nooe or the notice of excavation both of those are dig safe related documents we looked at the customer outage list where we were doing traces and figuring out you know customers that might be impacted from the work and we also went through and reviewed the environmental checklist or josh's app and determined that there were you know no environmental concerns so we don't have to request an environmental review for that so the last main piece of documentation is probably the more one of the more i guess trickier ones i know and you're probably like there's the document that's more tricky than what we've already done but yeah e n is a document that we will export out of storms you're going to have to have storms access you're going to have to have onedrive access all that fun stuff ivan i don't know how you lucked out but your onedrive seems to be in working order as of yesterday i feel like john we got one of yours set up and not the other can't remember where we stand with yours josh and i know i want to make i want to check with you megan on where your onedrive stuff stays isak and we couldn't get into either of mine okay yours is a yeah okay fullyutrently same thing it still i don't have access okay yep okay so then maybe yeah we'll walk through with you too maybe we we can get that squared away because i'll need to report back to jacob on that access because the sooner you you guys get that access the sooner you can you know not have to rely on myself or someone else to upload docs or download docs so on and so forth all right so going to back to share my screen and yeah that funding project thing is is usually something that doesn't get discovered until we it gets to our part of the process unfortunately all right so one of the things that we need to do is we're going to actually have to get the estimates in storm now i don't remember if we did any sort of send estimates to storms or design completed this application josh i can't remember showing in storms that i'm am i looking at the wrong app no i'm looking at the right app that there are no hours in storms listed so i'm going to go actually to the money symbol and see if maybe there's an estimate that was sent in that we didn't you know that didn't get registered with storms and maybe we have to calculate it on the pc to get it to show and i clicked that message this popped up' saying please complete the design process add a valid cu to the design before running cost estimates so it sounds like or it seems like we still need to send estimates to storms or design complete this i'm going to go ahead and just send the estimates to storms because storm in order for us to create the e n it needs input from gis so now we have a validation error which is probably the reason why we were unable to design complete or why small us gosh i can't talk today why storms is showing that message about needing to design complete because there was some issue between storms and i mean between gis and storms so it says errors have been found i'm going to click okay this will open up another window and this is our message it says record has no matching no associated design point and it looks like we're installing is that installing something i suspect it was just left over from when i re added in the primary wire yep that's exactly what it is so if you recall when we opened this up last time full primary was missing it got deleted and so what i had to do is go in and re add it again when i added the actual wire it's showing as an install which small world is interpreting as an action that needs to be accounted for in the work order but it's actually should be an existing so that was just a little issue when i added that so i can go ahead and hit the save button again go back into that explorer view and i'll re send those estimates to storms send estimates no warning messages and that error disappeared over here on the left so that should be good so now we're just waiting for storms to receive those estimates before we do that i want to double check a couple things on the poll just want to make sure that we electric is setting the new poll telephone is removing the old and for the point span editor the new poll doesn't have the dash jo which signifies that telephone is going to be responsible for that action so in this case telephone is removing this poll whereas national grid is setting this one so everything checks out with that so let's check on storms and hopefully it was quick oh no it wasn't still thinking up there it is so nothing was showing in my job so i opened up that money symbol and went to this calculate on pc and now we have costs based on the cost units that you selected in gis once you see this we can then go in and try to populate our e one and so how do we do that well before we do that i want to go into the requirements tab we want to make sure that we assign the two seventy requirement to your cell josh what's your storms user you no op in it's a cas t j one e j one te j one one that's it so what we want to do is we want to make sure that the two seventy is assigned to your cell and the reason why we do that is that when we print out the e n one of the fields that populates will then show your name as opposed to third party attachment group or whatever so how do we get to the reports so i'm in my job you' go to file properties reports and then we're looking for there's actually four different pages or sets of pages that we need to consider or export there's these four e n page one and two and then the request for telephone company or and so we're going to need to open and print to pdf each one of these files as it pertains to the e n so the first one and i just right click or select it modify and that opens it up in your small world view and so this is what it's going to look like now because we assign that two seventy requirement now it populates your name here rather than something out and so this is just the first page related to the electric portion of this poll replacement and it's just going to show us some basically to the joint owner from national grid with the job number the town town code and so we just it's auto generated a one next to item four which is just we're letting verizon know that we're intending to replace a joint own poll that would be two if there was two on the street and you're going to have one of these pages for every street with a poll replacement or other joint own asset replacement in this e so this could become a big document so in this case we just have the one poll so we have one page so to print this out we're going to go to the printer this opens up a little printer dialog box and i'm just going to hit ok and this is going to export to my onedrive national grid folder under the storms and so what i'll do for the naming convention because what we're going to do is we're going to export these four individual pdfs from storms and then combine them all together into a single document so this first page i usually refer to as the l or the e and i say l meaning el electric so l and i'll just do whatever the work order number is so three one two one zero nine seven l one i'm just going to grarafted that in my copy well doesn't okay so that exported this page to pdf so now i can close out of this because we got to export these to pdf before we can actually edit them so this is page two related to the electric work so that first page gave us kind of like a summary this actually gives us poll level details related to what we're doing so we' just this is what the existing poll information is and then what more setting the hight class whatever the auto treatment is and then how much the telephone company owes related to this replacement now because this is third party work because this is third party work the applicant is actually going to be paying for this work not telephone so what we'll do is when we're updating the e n we're going to take that twelve forty and make it a zero we're just going to zero it out no cost to telephone because it's the applicant that's paying for the work now if this was a pec poll replacement which in fact it is meaning that it is notvillable to the applicant then verizon or the joint owner would actually be build the twelve four so we're not actually going to leave that there for this particular application because it was ac nonvillable poll replacement and national grid and verizon are going to be sharing the costs associated with replacing it whereas if it wasvillable to the applicant the applicant would be basically paying for the replacement i'm going to go back in going to print and i just exported this one and i'm just going to change this to l two what you name them whatever you want to do we're just going to combine them all together into one file anyways so we got that exported next we're doing the telephone versions of those documents that we just exported you're going to right click modify and so it's going to look just like the other four except this one says request for telephone work and it's to the joint owner all this stuff auto populates note that nothing auto populates in here that's something that we're going to have to edit on this document so that's another way of knowing that you're looking at the telco page one is that well it says telco up here and then also nothing auto populates down here then we have our street name and then a spot to put a sketch i'm going to export i'm going to print that out onedrive' even i'm going to call this one tellel one and repeat for the eon tellelcode two and it's the same format as the other one except we're talking about what's happening with the old pole and so in this case telephone is removing the old pole so the old pole is the existing plant and we have a code of remove for e so we're just saying tent pole ten is being removed and the tellelp you know is going to be zero likely here exp that and i'm going to change that to tellel two so that's just to get the exports now one of the things that i will do because as you can see this was kind of cumbersome to export all of these and then just to find out that maybe something is missing you you just did a job with ten different pole replacements and you exported all of them you combine them all together and then you realize that you're missing a pole replacement on main street it's like well now i got to figure out ingis what i did to make it so it doesn't show up on the e n and so a lot of times what i'll do is i'll look at page two of the electric and use that did i just just took a second and i will use this to basically double check that everything is added because you'll have one of these pages for every sheet and it's giving you the poll details so you know if i on my e five have ten poles that meet ten join on poles that are being replaced i can double check that to page two before actually going in and exporting all of the e n documents i've exported those docs those documents and so now i need to go into my onedrive for storms i'll launch that and i have a storms docs folder and there are my files and so you can actually select them copy them and open up your local directory right click paste try dragging and dropping that doesn't work that's nice that you're able to just do that from this window which is good so now we've downloaded all the the pdfs and they're now on my local machine now we want to combine them all into a single file so i usually do l one and two and then tell one and two to for right click combine in adobe acrobat and then here you can go in and update the order if you wanted to we're going to go in and fix the order anyways especially if we had multiple you know we had lots of pages with work we'll want to keep them pretty organized and i'll show you an example of that after this but l one and two tell one and two combine and then this just creates a combined pdf called binder one because this is just something that i'm working on i usually will just put for my things that i'm working on so'll do to n with the work order number and then i'll just add working as now i have my combined pdf with the documents that make up so i have my electric page one that's talking about the new pole that's being placed and then i have my telephone page one which is then talking about the pole that's being removed and there is your e n and i will point out that there is information about this in the document that i updated few years ago it should be i tried to i tried to i explained it this kind of similar way you know page one page two and talked about assembling and all that so there's there's information in the process dock related to assembling this as well all right so the first thing that i'm going to do is i need to add my contact information down at the bottom here i have my in this case it will be josh contact so we're going to go in and i'm going to grab the edit button now your interface here for adobe might look a little bit different than mine i've noticed that with other folks when i've been looking at their their adobe butt i want to find this add text button which will then allow us to add text at the bottom or really wherever we want to add it i'm going to make it bigger so we can actually see it and i'm going to type prepired by i actually have like on i i do a lot of like sticky notes not like sticky notes on my desk but like the sticky notes through i basically selected a bunch of things and i just created a trail let's minimize that so i like made this sticky note the other day and so i have a list of sticky notes of things that and for one of my sticky notes i have a lot of these elements pasted in so i can just copy and paste instead of typing i hate typing prepared by and then we're going to just say i gotaip my back in there we're going to type in josh right and then cos mode utility purposes and phone number i'll let you update that after obviously you can make this big or smaller as you need as you need to just add that there at the bottom on first sheet and that's it okay so now we need to update our sheets so this one is auto generated there's that big white space for a sketch which you know we created an noe earlier which already has that sketch i mean we didn't really need the noe but i still created the sketch still have that in here so what i can do is i can actually edit it some more one yep and add some additional elements that we need on the e n so i need my i need to stick my sticky note has a lot of this information so i need to slide the stickies off the screen and and so usually at the bottom of the e n sketch we put you know basically what appears here the voltage the reason for work and then we also put the the name of the engineer and so instead of adding a little text box and adding it there i've just been incorporating it onto my sketches so so you can take my notes here populated i have a text that i'm pasting in that i you know pull pull across the bottom now the voltage is just going to be whatever the primaryation for the poull work in this case it's seven point six two so i'm just going to change this to seven and then i also want to add at the top we do we have a thing that just says sketch so we've started adding where we add the to copy this paste it and so i basically have the header with sketch third party request and then it's going to be the application name which in this case is this b gosh see i screwed up have to undo it i'll just just add the application name into my sticky note so it just spot here we go all right so now i have my e n sketch squared away so i'll save it and sketches and then i can come back into my e n and add the image grab the eon sketches and then just kind of drop it in the middle just drag it dra your edges to fit in the the section here and grab it and then scroll that up hover fill the box okay copy that scroll over to this next sheet down here paste the same textbx in just the telephone version of this so now we have the sketch squared away for both page ones all right so this sheet's good aside from josh putting in his phone number that auto generated that's good so we're going to go on to the next sheet this is sheet two for electric this is the sheet where we're going to leave the twelve forty because because this is a pec poll the applicant's not paying for it it's going to be handled internally by national grid and paid for that way so i'm going to leave the twelve forty cost on the e n one thing i would add here is a telephone tag usually if it's not built in i put in n t i wouldn't really worry too much about getting that updated with an actual telephone tag they're not as tricky about that in new england as they are in new york and then i move on to my telco sheet so on here i don't need to add josh's contact information below i don't have to futs with the page number thing at the bottom doesn't really just assembling a pdf to create this eon document so all we're going to add here is a number one next to or basically replace i mean we're mirroring what the page one of this document shows now if we were replacing anchors number seven would be filled in and those are the only options it's either four or seven none of these other ones for the most part are going to be filled in with this type of e one now occasionally we'll do a buy in e n where we'll buy into a poll and that's where we might actually use item one but that's separate i'll confuse you with that the telephone work i'm going to just add the one there move on to the next page and then all i need to do here is or is it bo or make it smaller and then we're done that was the e one so i mean it was a lot more prep work and getting it set up and then when you actually get in there to fill it out or update it there's not a ton to do so i'm just going to buy f save as gosh go n and i'm just going to call this one the file act work order number and now we have our e n all right and then the last thing that i want to kind of go over now is requesting stateway permits so in massachusetts we'll need to provide a mass dot permit when i say we i mean us or osmos or not necessarily we're actually going to be requesting the to be created by our permittent team so once we put in this request the permanent will actually do all the work with researching and preparing the permitting but we just need to request it and so master permit is required for any electric make ready work digging and non digging within the right way to state maintained roads so basically poles that are along state or u highways in massachusetts now not all state highways in massachusetts or identified state highways are going to be maintained by the dot the example that i like to use is down the street from where i used to lives i used to live that's oops what what happened in naples that's not what thinkingxborough and so in foxboro this is route one forty state highway one forty in google maps state highways are represent by these represented by these like pill shapes and us highways or interstates are usually shields there' interstate ninety five and then i know route one is also a shield and but they're they're treated like the state highways are as well as far as these what i wanted to show you was that google maps this is all state highway you know one four but you know and it continues on up here goes around on the bend da but not all of that is maintained by the dot so if you actually go into street view i do realize that you know we have folks on this call that are not living in massachusetts and so maybe things are a little bit different for where you're living but i' going to find a sign where' it says state highway begins so basically this is one forty all to this direction but the state only maintains the roadway from this point that way and so what we need to do is there's actually a website that we can check see what roadways are maintained or fall within the dot jurisdiction that would be this state highway layout control click to get that to and i do think with the job that i was that i think we were training on our first day that walmart app i believe one of those pos was along state highway one twenty three so we're going to use that as the example i have that app on my other monitor and i'm going to grab the coordinates and i'm going to paste those into this view and so brockton f is also one twenty three we've established now when i actually go in there and look so this is our poll with work if the polls along the road way i'm not a hundred percent sure how they're going to access this poll i don't want to assume that they're just going to park in this parking lot i mean it's on the roadway along the roadway i want to at least request the dot permits if they are in fact needed when we request them from the permitting team they'll actually go in and look and decide you know well do we need it do we not need it and if they actually have questions they'll ask them that way that was but so this is our poll and it's along state highway one twenty three or brockton a and so what i want to do now is i want to look i want to find this location on that mass mapper i mean this where do they go on this state highway layouts window here and so we're in brockton i see brockton right here and we're looking for that that walmart and i probably should just go to where it is brockton a there is a layout a satellite view that we can switch to if it's easier for you to see where things are in satellite view so for me i work better in satellite view we the walmart just try to play these games with myself or am i in the wrong i'm not even in it's not in brockton it's brockton a but in abington all right so this is why let's just go to brockton abington clearly i don't know where i'm looking so there it is and our walmart was up here okay so back to whatever the main view was i't remember what it was okay so our walmart is here and so what we're looking for is green lines the legend there we go so we're looking for a green line which represresents mass dot jurisdiction and so you can see kind of hiding behind that blue polygon which i don't think really has any bearing on what we're doing so you got to kind of look for it we're looking for that green line so our poll is like right in here so it's along a section of state highway one twenty three that is maintained by the dot so we do need to request mass dot permits for this particular poll and so how do we do that we got to request via a smartsheet i don't know i'll have to see how people's accesses are for smartheet see sign in with email and password and so this just opens up a very basic form that we've had for a bunch of years now to request the mass dot permits so i'm going to update the work order number add the application name well i don't know why there's even an option because this is just for mass dot and so what it is is it's looking for us to drop files here it wants us to drop there's a specific form that we're going to need to fill out so it's a spreadsheet so control click or the second link to navigate to the folder so let's go to the folder and so the folder has this mass permit request app name copy that and i'm going to go loc that and oh yeah this is the right app i think and so we would fill up this form this template i'm going to put the work order number up here the application name again that's not a good application name the application name is this one short so the description here is just going to be a summary of kind of like we add in the description section on our construction sketches just them summary of what work is falls under this this permit request and so in this case it's just going to be this one poll with installing a down guy honestly i don't think they're going to end up needing the permits but we'll request them anyways we're just going to say one poll with guying and then we would update this sheet for each element or each poll that falls along the state highway that we want to include in these permits so this first poll the only poll is sixty one thirty and it was on rorockten it's also st high way one two three we're going to just note well which page of the construction sketches is it on so i exported this one the other day so it should be in my oh did i move it locally i so it's looking for the page or the sheet that the poll is found on in this case it's going to be sheet one you can kind of faintly see the one there or over here here on the right so it's on sheet one so i'll just update one and then i'm going to put the coordinates now i like typing i usually keep the coordinates handy here in the format that i like to see them in now they're over here on the right but when i put the coordinates in here because sometimes the coordinates that you plug in might not necessarily be right where the poll is sometimes it's from the vantage pointint of where the survey is taking the photo or vice versa you know however it may be but i like to just when i usually go in and do this i'm always you know looking at where the coordinates are relation to where the poll is and updating accordingly so coordinates and i'm just going to paste those in here if i can get the paste my pasting isn't really work there we go and then i would do that for every poll that falls along the state highway for all my sheets etcet it says for the naming convention on this we basically going to name the file as this is just ma permit request and then we're going to replace the act name here with whatever the name is so fo save a copy okay and that's saved and so now i have that i have the construction sketches i think the last thing that that we need to include is this oh the c form so we need to include that sheet that we just filled out the construction sketches and then the final which i already have as well to verify that's actually the final one and not one with my extra comments in there that doesn't look like a five let's try that again just going to open up every single excel file that i already have open so i'm already open i already have it open so there's my final so that's what we need to include so i will select these three items drag those into this form all items attached send me a copy and then i'm going to submit this and so the request would go to the permitting team who will eventually send out a response from smartsheet with information to charge on the workmagement have which is still kind of up in a based on the changes as related to the work management calculator but we have two fields on the calculator that we're generally updating two here we go so it's we have we have a permit fee support you know i think that might know i'm not even going because i do think some of this stuff is changing i know that there's in the past there's been an hourly rate for preparing the permits and then a mass dot flat fee and when i say preparing the permits that would be for the prming team's time and not our time related to requesting them so that's the mass dot stuff and in the process doc i do have easements and i whole petitions they are very few and far between i'm not even going mention them at this point i think i've done more poll petitions than easements but i think in the entirety that i've been working and doing work orders i've done like three poll petitions so i mean they're very very infrequent and that is kind of long and the long part i would say not the short part but the long part of the documentation we just went through thech of notice or the e when and then we ran through the requesting of a state highway permit so obviously lots lots went over any questions or thoughts or know is smoke coming out of your ears is your head spinning where folks at definitely spinning so we do this ad that we get our q feedback right from our gis so so i'm going to have you guys do so when we do the no you're going to do this these these this these steps will be qced as part of the rest of the work order so you would go go in and you know do your gis edits build your work order do your construction sketches any of the relevant permitting you know and then there would be you know a few other final thing tasks that we would do and then i would use it or someone okay that makesense ideally i want to you know because we foret if you see i want to you know we could have you know several emails back and forth and i don't really want to have like one email for half of the work order one email for the other half all right but yeah so you would do documentation the documents depending on the work that you had in your work order so i know with the job that you were assigned i've been or no the job that you're working on you have a poll replacement and so you'll need to run through a lot of this paperwork that we just went through right right okay and i know john with your your new app that you have you have a few pole replacements so i know you have digging work josh we just use yours as an example and i know megan i think your first job is not digging work but i think the second one that i assigned you would be would have that work so i think we're all working on various apps with various types of situations so we're not all working on the same type of app with digging work at this point but yeah no there's quite a bit there you got a question i was just going to say if it makes you feel any better for the people the call that process even though it's tedious and seems long way easier than if you were doing dot in pennsylvania so you should feel lucky in pennsylvania yeah it's a super pain pennsylvania and the state of washington are the worst i worked i still previous a previous job i worked with historical aerial photography and one of the projects that we worked on was we provided a aerial photos for the entire length of the pennsylvania turnpike in like quarter mile no in three quarter mile segments was quite fun i would imagine so yeah fun yeah any other questions comments is it the time for lunch yet i think it's time for lunch i'm really i'm hungry s i think i'm going to stop sharing and i'm going to stop the recording i tw i'm always not i'm not really mindful of the time i usually take later lunches like one thirty two o'clock so but definitely lunch time definitely on the

VIDEO_ID: Creating a Make Ready Work Order Number.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] all right going to run through creating a make ready work order number for an application in new england i am going to share my screen there and so i'm going to be actually referencing a process document it's located under the work order resources folder process documents and it's called create work order in new england shortcut to and that's just kind of referencing the document that this is associated with as you can see with the bubble that's popped up the actual document located in the design team folder so we're all kind of using the same document to actually create these jobs i'm going to double click this to open it i already have it open i do okay and so it's back up here all right and so just to point out this document has multiple audiences for so it has audiences well it used to have multiple audiences but i guess there's some things in here that are a little dated i guess i would say but like there's new york references in this document but we're basically only creating new england stuff and so we were actually probably using this document in the past to do some new york stuff as well so just note that there might be some things in here that reference new york all right and so we're going to be using this document to create dystipia or yama work order numbers and we're going to be copying from a sad work request the sad work order numbers are the application that we get from national grid comes through as a sad so working on this application gateway linux six and then there's one work order number listed here and this is usually in new england going to be your sad work request number and the sad work request number that in the storms cancell closed and so when you look at it in storms it's going to show up as nonesigned it's going to have a job type of not even going try to say it we call it sad work request and these cover survey and design and so this is the first request that osmos gets for the application and this is where we will bill the survey and the design aspects of this application and so what we're going to do is we're going to copy this to start the creation of this dystipia job type that i need for my application i've gone into the e five to double check what i have for work you know and a i have a couple poll replacements one there poull replacement here according to the according to the word document that talks about capital versus maintenance pull that up replacing poll is considered a capital item we're going to be creating a dystciipia for this application a lot of times these are created by the designers and so there's steps in this document related to closing out and progressing and adding requirements to the sad work request so we're going to be kind of bouncing around between the sad and the dystipia all right so' going to drop this down so it's off the screen so i can expand everything all right so we're going to create a dystipia now one thing i did notice in helix is that this particular application has a funding project number we're going to make sure we need to account for that as well so the first thing on the process doc is talking about on the sad work request number we need to make sure that the two twenty six and the two fifty four requirement are completed again these are normally created by the designers but they're going to be designers out there that do not have access to storms and if they don't have access to storms they can't create the make ready work order numbers so on the sad work request number i need to make sure that the two twenty six and the two fifty four requirements are completed go into the requirements tab this is kind of just double checking or acq seeing the designer i don't see a two twenty six here i'm going to add one the two twenty six is let's see here two twenty six is ties to a field survey so field surveyte that going to add my name here in case there's questions about why it was added tw six okay so that's added okay the other requirement is that the two fifty four is is we have to make sure that that is completed as well that's tied to reconcile the application with telco well if the application is in the work order queue then it's been reconciled by telephone so we're going to mark this requirement as complete as well okay now i'm going to do what's the next part of this i guess we need to make sure that the associated parties is filled out on the sad work request number we have not actually done this yet for any of the dystippias that we've progressed through the system so far associated parties tab is just something that kind of let's national grid know information about the msa and so to add an associated party we're going to right click in the whitespace add opens up another little text box okay so for entity id i'm going to just type in tp for notes i'm just going to put my name i think the default that these will be coming through in if they're updated properly would be teddy torres i'm just going throw my name in here osmos is the description the proposal number is six hundred i' to add my phone number and then i'm going to skip all of this and i'm going to go down to this name field and i'm just going to add a period this is just basically we don't have to go in search for an actual street associated with this work but we have to put something in there and so usually i put a period in there and that will not throw any errors and allow us to move forward with this and so basically with the associated parties we're tryinging to fill out these fields here and so entity type description will be my name will be osmos six hundred my phone number and then my name okay all right we're there we will also need to do that on the d stipia as well potentially okay now we're going to go into the sad general window here and i'm going to go to edit copy work order opens up this box it also opens up a warning window it says the required date on the work request is being copied is set in the past okay that's fine same thing here is just letting us know that are these dates have already gone by which is fine and so we're going to go in and we're going to start updating some of these things so the required by date and the scheduled date it's going to be six months from the date that we're creating this work order so today is the nineteenth eleven nineteen so december january february march april may so i'm going do let's seeash nineteent slash twenty twenty six i tell you doing work orders makes the year go by so quickly because everything is six months ahead all right so that's good that's going to be the first thing that we're going to fix all right and we're going to go down in here and we're going to check the comments the associated parties the geographical network work order documents and remarks we're going to uncheck optional requirements and we're going to uncheck material substitutions if it was checked so it's not so we're going to copy the comments from the sad work request we're going to copy the associated parties that we just filled out we're copying any information in the geographical tab we're also copying over any of the documents that are associated with the sad request and also the remarks over to the next one now we need to come over to this side and we need to change well what kind of job type do we need to create in this one we went in and determined that i need a capital work request so i'm going to change this work order type to designed and then from the pick list for job type i'm going to pick dystipia two then i'm going to hit the copy button that will do its thing i can start to see the sun coming out here well maybe not just just the very first part of the light coming through the window here all right so now we're going to do is i'm going to slide these two windows side by side because we're going to want them open together because we're going to be updating things on both of them so i have the sad work request number on my left and on the right we have the dystipia okay and so what we want to do is we want to copy the application name from the sad work request over to the dystipia so i'm just going to grab the application name and semicon paste it in there there is a limit on this you know somet ofimes these default third party attacher and survey design some of these will get kind of wordy and this description box doesn't have a ton of space so if we end up in a situation where we don't have enough room to copy in the application name i would just trim down this portion of the description you know maybe it's maybe get rid of the disk oh u g something the most important part for as far as we're concerned is going to be making sure that that application name is there and so sometimes we'll have to remove notes in the description already to make that happen okay so on the sad work order number we want to reference the dystipia work order number that we created to progress the application so in the extra info section of the window here i'm going to do semicolon c eta work order number and then this is going to be the work order number that i just created so that would be this three one two four five five three nine i'll just double check that three one two four five five three nine allight copy that i'm also going paste that under the remarks tab i'm going to add a tpmr remark so we normally add tpg remarks when we're adding our notes into stores related to progress in the application construction support costs we're going to add a tpmr which is the third party make ready remark type and that's where i'm just going to paste the note c and whatever that dystipia work order number is i'm going to hit okay now we're referencing the dcipia in the remarks and in the extra information we're going to go on the other side to the dyipia and now we're going to reference the sad work request number so c sad work order number and then it's three one one three one seven four nine double check three one one three one seven four nine and then i'm just going to copy that and i'm going to go back into my remarks so you going want to save yes same thing in here again we're going to add a tpmr tp m and the sad work order number all right so now we've cross referenced the work order numbers between the two applications we have the extra info field and as tpg remarks tpmr remarks we're also going to want to add the dystipia work order number to helix and the ei final so we'm going to take that dystipia i'm going to paste that here dcipia work order number here i'm going to open up my e five for this job and we have our dystciipia work order number referenced in helix and in our e five now we're going to go back into the sad work request number go back into the requirements here we're going to set the environmental checklist in the two sixty sevens to not required modify just set that to required and the two sixty seven is not required because this is the sad work request we're not going to be doing any sort of checklist and we're not adding attachments attachments are associated with the capital or yamo make ready request so going not require that one as well all right two and then and then we're going to add a two seventy seven requirement to the sad work request here and so you should be able to go into this add optional some requirements you're accessible through the add optional other times you have to right click add this is one of those ones where we go to the optional looking for a two seventy seven associated make ready work order has been create is what the requirement great english i think we might have run out of characters on that one but so what we're going to do is assign this to third party ne that is going to be tag for national grid new england and so this is basically saying hey tag we've gone ahead and created the capital make ready request for this application you can begin to close the sad work request number out so we're going to hit okay there on the new make ready work request number i think we're all set with this i'll minimize that for now on the new make ready work request number we went into associated parties those copied over from the sad so we don't need to add those again and go into the requirements tab and so we're going to set the one the one fifty five and the two fifteen to complete we've gone over requirements on the screen share i might have gone through with you what these requirements were and they're normally completed when the designer whoever's making the work order number okay now the next one involves the funding project number and so we're going to go to that financials tab and so these all default as take a step back here this is where we're going to be plugging in our financials we're going to be plugging in that same financial number for each one of these instances so installation removal and transfer will all have the same financials seeing that it says get work order bw over here implies to me that we have not actually hit the get work order button which is good because if we hit this button we would lock in these funding this funding project which is blanket western so basically any work that's capital it doesn't have its own customer specific funding project will get added under blanket financials okay so what we're going to do is we're going to go into helix and there is a funding project number right here so i'm going to copy that and then i'm going to come back into the financials tab here and i'm going to paste over each one of those items then actually if you go into the little dropown you can actually see the descriptor about the funding project number that we just added and this one notes it's gateway infrastructure in lennox massachusetts so that's what that number represents i'm going to hit save and now i'm ready to hit the get work order button and this will lock the financials in once you hit this button there's no going back and fixing something from an earlier step in terms of maybe updating the required or scheduled date or going back in maybe you added the wrong financials and you want to go back and fix that once you hit this get work order number we've locked in financials for this application and in order to get new financials in we would have to basically create a whole new work order number to do that so why we're always kind of like got to be careful in here all right so i'm going to hit the get work order button and that has a little window that pops up waiting for response went the way now note that the get work order over here changed to numbers that's good toggle off and it's going to say yes to my saving my changes now doing that to confirm that that worked okay you go to the requirements tab and that auto completes the two fifty so that's how that two fifty requirement gets completed if the two fifty is not completed when you first come into a job it's likely that the financials have not been locked in maybe there was a question about whether or not there was a funding project because you we've had two jobs this week that we've been trying to write where they're in towns that might have funding projects but we're not aware of a funding project quite yet so maybe they left the financials tab unudated because they were unsure about whether a funding project was going to be needed all right go back into the requirements tab here we're going to complete the two fifty one the two fifty two i tried to explain and probably wasn't explaining it super well in my individual conversations with folks yesterday so i'm going to re explain this again so the two fifty two is tied to getting payment for the survey and design portion of this application okay and so there's actually a two fifty two on the sad work request and then the make ready work request okay and so what we do with the two fifty two in our make ready work request number depends on how it is in the sad work request okay so the two fifty two is completed on the sad so that means to me that they got payment for this the survey and design aspect of the work so that's good that means that i could complete it on my dystciipia job because there is no payment that we need to get there is no outstanding two fifty two on the sad now if this sad work request over here was still required that tells me that we that national grid has not seen that payment yet and so what we'll need to do is we'll need to basically remind tag that they're going to need to bill the applicant still for that survey and design so this would still be required over here and then on our dystciipia job type we would change this from complete to required and then we're going to assign that to third party and should be required and that would be only if the two fifty two on the sad work request was partial or required usually when it's partial it means that an invoice has been sent to the customer and they just haven't received it back required usually means that they haven't done anything with it yet so we update the two fifty two on our capital job dependent on how it shows on the survey and design okay we do not complete the two fifty two on the sad work request that is national grid so we complete that they might not know that they didn't bill something and then it gets lost in the shuffle so national grid is in charge of the two fifty two on the sad work request and then we can go ahead and update it depending on how that is shown in the sad okay the two fifty two is going to be completed here the two fifty four is just kind of saying that yes we did reconcile with telco complete that because we completed that on the sad now we're going to add some of those requirements that we confirmed when we were going through our final t we're going to be adding a two fifty three and the two eighty three requirement so neither of these are in the optional window here so we're going to have to manually add these requirements you're going to right click add and then we're going to go requirement two fifty three and i'm just copying from the process dock here and it's called trigger order of long lead time items couldn't tell you exactly what that means or its purpose other than i think these requirements allow i don't know they trigger billing i think either on the national grid side or osmo side or even both couldn' tell you but where we're adding them so two fifty three trigger order of long lead time items we're going to change this to complete add to my work queue because it's a good habit to get into and then i'm the responsible on this one so whoever adds it responsible and there's nothing that we're doing with it it's just a requirement that's going live in this dystipia job type so i'm going to go in add go back into two a three this one is review project dates and order materials and add to my queue complete and i'm going assign it to myself okay now we've added the two eighty three the two fifty three and the two eighty three now the two sixty seven is going to get bypassed two sixty seven is tied to adding the attachments in gis because on your we have our e five it looks like this is at lenux app and so they applied to forty two pols and after we go in and do the design and write our work order and eventually this work goes up in the field and is constructed in the field someone's going to go into all of these polls and they're going to add an attachment representing this particular applicant in this case it's gateway being attached to the poll and those are usually added these won't have any because i'm out in the middle of where i was like where i had a friend that i went to college with that was from where and she would be like i'm from where like where't have too much fun with that but so you go into the poll and there's a child editor called poll attachment and so this is where someone not you but someone after this job has been completed out in the field will go in and add attachments for all of these polls so that shows that the applicant is licensed and that's how national grid tracks who's licensed on what polls and so on and so forth we have the type of attachment the attache code is going to tell you who the applicant is in this case eleven oh seven is this mbi it's in the communication space the type is a fiber optic this is the work order number the sad work order number and then this is the date that it was added okay and so we're bypassing the two sixty seven in new york we would be adding the two we would be adding the attachments right in our job but in new england we're not and i think the reason why we do that is that you know it takes almost six it takes a while for these applications to work their way through new england's review queue whereas in new york it's not as long or extensive all right so two sixty seven enter we're just going to bypass this and let's see who am i assigning it to what's the guy's user name okay a e link the national grid user that'll be bypassing those two okay and believe that's it now as a work order writer if you're creating these you might want to you could probably save yourself some time later on down the road because i know we're going to end up marking the four eighty one modify that and we're setting that to not required that's a requirement that we would be setting to not required when we go through the finalization steps of our work order as well i can take care of that now also the seven twelve and thirteen i'm going to modify those and i'm going to set those to not required by not required okay there's some other things to look at so you'll note that there is a two ninety nine requirement in here i had mentioned in the past that these jobs may have a two ninety nine and so basically this is just letting us know that there are no cost units in the job that basically validates the job type as you can also see there's no three fifty created as well and so once i create this application i mean once i start writing a work order and i send estimates from gis back to storms storms will receive those estimates they'll check and say oh is there any capital asset cost units associated with this gis design because i have a decipia and it will say oh it does and then it will basically get rid of that two ninety nine and allow the three fifty to auto populate and complete so that two ninety nine will go away once we have input from gis that validates the job type so now that i've created the work order number i can go ahead and send my job to gis i can start my gis edits and write this work order and that is creating a capital make ready work request number from a sad work request number we could use the same process with the yamos as well and that completes my training thank you

VIDEO_ID: An_Alternative_To_Pulling_Guard_When_Grappling_On_The_Knees.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] so often you start wrestling on the knees and pretty common is for two guys to lock up and they push each other and they push each other and eventually he pushes me over and then i start working for my guard either that or we're starting on the knees i'm going pull guard and i start working right away why not if you're going to pull guard why don't you pull a sweep instead i'm going to give a couple of examples here as we tie up i'm going to get a grip a cross grip and a sleeve grip post my foot this looks pretty innocuous from here i'm going to jump i can jump into any sweep that i want whatever sweep i'm good at i should try and find a way to get into it in this case i'm going to do a scissor sweep just for illustration so here i'm going to jump and pull and sweep right away if that works great i've already swept him got in a great position if it doesn't work i've ended up in guard where i was going to go anyhow you're going to go no gee you can do the same thing except you might go with a collar and an arm grip here you really got to make sure you control the neck when you're going no gee i'm going to sweep here but if i don't control the head and i go here he can simply step over and pass or leg lock me just a second sweep that you might want to try either off an under hook or off of an overhook where you get the lapel obviously this is the gee variation' here we're here i control the sleeve i'm going to step in to the basic butterfly instead of going to the guard and then fighting for the butterfly sweep i might as well just jump into the butterfly sweep directly you can do the same thing standing up let's take a look at just a couple basic sweeps there's the tripod sweep foot on the hip foot behind the knee grabbing the heel i sweep him back stand up please and based off that same heel grip there's a lumberjack where i sidekick him in the belly and i chop his rear ankle i can do both those off of standing we're here we're here i grab something i go in and i sweep him or i go in and i sweep him right away so why jump to guard and then fight for the sweep why not jump to the sweep just an idea

VIDEO_ID: PreparingDigSafesNOEs.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] all right i'm going to run through the digafe and the notice of excavation process for the application that i'm working on this these are tied to digging work so pole replacements anchor replacements down ground rod replacements push brace replacements any digging work so my application has it has three pole one two three pole replacements okay better probably just to look at just the work itself okay so all right so we have three pole replacements so those will be right off the bat be d safe items and then we also have a replacing of the single downground when we raise the termination bracket here that the downround that represents the down ground and rod which is underground if you look at see if you go into the standards manual i can find it there it is there's the book so go into here and i'm just going to search out that standard three dash one eleven two big one okay and then i'm just going to no itn't it wasn't three dash one on one that's the push brace it's thirteen dash one on one thirteen there we go rounding and i just want to grind so thirteen and twelve there's and so this is thirteen dash one one one two one eleven b one twelve one thirteen and so with the downground in rod it's you know this whole piece is being replaced and then there is going to be rods underground that will get replaced as well this is a double so you actually all have two different grounds underground as well so double would be for delta circuits single for y circuits and the point of this is just to show that there is going to be some of this underground that needs to be replaced when we call the replace the single downground in rod and so therefore it's going to be considered digging work so that is also d so we have three pole replacements and a replace single vertical downground now the way that the dig safes work is that we can put up to three contiguous or consecutive poles onto a digafe as long as they have the same set of cross streets so example's find a nice easy one here so we're going to pretend that these house numbers are pole numbers so two two one two two five and two two three can be all on one digafe because theyull those poles are all on the same you know they're in line there's no like skipped poles in between them and they both have the same they stra the same set of intersecting streets so kondike and delford but if you had one pole here and here and then another one here this pole on this side would actually have to be on its own digafe document because this pole has its own unique set of cross streets okay so i'm going to look at my construction sketches for this and let's see so pole six twenty five can both go on the same dig safe because they're consecutive poles and then we would need separate digafes for this pole which is pole twenty two this is the single vertical downg ground because the next poll with digging work is twenty but there's a pole in between there they're not contiguous or you consecutive pos if we were replacing pole twenty one instead of twenty we would put twenty one and twenty two on the same digsafe but these will have to be on their own digafe so it looks like it's going to be three dig safes for this work okay and so to get the dig safe you go into go into the work water resources folder and there's a folder called ds comma noe nooe is just referring to the notice of excavation it's another document that we will provide for some towns tied to the digging work that we're doing so usually you'll come in here first and you'll open up this noe town by town water and sewer contact list so i have that open now behind the scenes and so this is going to give you there's tabs at the bottom and so what basically you going to find out where your town is and so i'm in quincy which is base state south and so now i'm looking for quincy in this list and so this is going to basically tell us do we need to do a notice of excavation or not okay the notice of excavation as you probably already now know is a section within the digsafe form itself open up that digafe form and so at the very bottom of this there's a section related to the municipal notification what are we doing or how we what do we need to do as far as notifying the municipality and so we'll get that information from this table and depending on what the result is we may or may not need to do a noe okay in this particular case quincy is considered a dig safe member okay so that means you do not need to do a notice of excavation you will still need to do a dig safe but no notice of excavation is required for dig safe members okay also if there's no sewer or water we won't do a notice of excavation so like in western massachusetts a lot of these towns don't have water or sewer so if we're doing work in alford there's no water no sewer there's no need to do an nooe tied to water and sewer so if they're digsafe members or if they are there's no water no sewer we don't have to do the nooe now sometimes you will get towns like adams here where water water is a digafe member but the noe for the sewer wants a phone call so there might be some differences within the town so it's just things to keep in mind when looking at that at this and obviously if there's questions you can always reach out and ask somebody so quincy i'm in base state south so quincy does not need a noe but we do need to do a digsafe document i will run through the nooe process for just one just to show you how to populate that in this video because this video is for digsafe hand nooe i just happen to have an app that doesn't require one so quincy is a digsafe member so i'm going to close the form minimize this and then from the digsafe nooe shared location i'm going to copy these to my local folder i have a local folder for this particular job and i'll paste those in there i also like to add to the name at the end of the dig safe what the work order number is three one two one five six five three open up the digafe and that work will up right there okay so before we actually go in and update this i like to get all of my digging work into a map view because when we create the nes back to the noe form there's a sketch section so if we were doing an noe we would need to provide a sketch so a lot of times what i'll do is when i go in and do my dig saves i'll create a digging csv that has the coordinates for all of my polls that have digging work that i can then import into google maps and view in a map view and so let's do that now so and so the csv that i'm talking about is just going to be the design csv that we get for the application it's also potentially in helix as well and so my job here's my i believe that's the design csv it is it's got my information about all my pictures and my pos so i'm just going to go in here and i'm going to add a column and then i'm just going to go through okay so twenty six granite is digging so for the very first instance of that pole in the csv has a bunch of the has the coordinates actually it looks like a lot of them have the coordinates but the latitude and longitude of the fields that i use to populate my maps with so that's what the the first record of that pole in your csv i'll put thex next to so twenty six twenty five twenty two is for the downground and rod and then twenty and then what i'll do is i will filter out just those digging fields it looks like i added it to the wrong field but it doesn't matter i just wanted to basically isate i'm just using it to isolate these records so i can then create a separate csv they all have the coordinates so copy that into a new move and copy new book file save as and this is just going to go into the same location that i have with my working folder i like to just try to stay organized like that let go into my work orders and gran it and then i'm just going to change the system type i mean oh my gosh might be time for more coffee after this video the csv and i'm going just going to note this as digs okay so now i have my digs csv and so now i'm going to open up google maps and so i'm not sure if you're able to do this without a gmail account i have my gmail account i have a personal gmail account and so i just use that but so you can come into your map here and i go to saved maps and i go to maps tab and at the very bottom there's a create map option and then i can go in and import that csv that i just created so that dig csv okay that's fine well it's going to auto mark the latin long as a where we're positioning these points that's good and then i'm going to select well what the if i want to label the polls i'm going to do structure number and then there's our polls okay now we have all of our polls listed in shown in google maps and then i'll use this to you know maybe create my sketches for my noe if i wanted to i'll use this for my environmental checklist filling that out i also use this to create the sketches for my eon so i really do use this map for a lot of different things i like that you can actually come in and you know delete polls if you wanted to and then re add them and you can update the colors and all that fun stuff so i have my digging poles all in the same into this digs csv here okay and then to keep myself straight i also usually have a see nope that's not it cancel i usually create axt text file in my working folder here and i call this notes and then i'm just going to make a note of what digafes i need to do so it's going to be twenty five and six are going to be on one digsafe so i'm justull twenty fiveull twenty six and then pull twenty and then poll twenty two so three digsafe so back to the digsafe form that i have open and write a roll so the i've already added my work order number the department is going to be whatever barn in is responsible for this work and that is going to be this true headquarters field in storms so i'm going to copy that i drop that in here so we're in mass the county i can get out of storms norfork so the l long if i have for this first digafe i'm putting two poles on the digafe so i'm just going to say instead of just one specific you know one specific set of coordinates i'm just going to say multiple city below if there was one pole being included on this digsafe i would just add a coordinates for a lat long field the town muni is quincy and then the street address let's see the first two pols are down here they're probably on either side of this house here of course one thing i don't like is that the okay one sixty five i'll validate that with my construction sketches as well and where is this construction sketches yeah one sixty five is probably the and i now that i'm looking at it i think this might actually be on its own digsafe now too because it really has its own set of unique cross stres right it's between fort and school this pole is between fort and partner i mean that's kind of it's very close very very close i'm i'm going to add i'm going to make a separate digafe for those two because it's good practice here allighty so for poll twenty five i have in my e five already the coordinates and i'm actually going to go back into my digsafe form here because i'm only going to put the one pole on it i'm just going to add coordinates and i'm going to do one sixty five granite stre as this address between for this pole twenty five that's twenty six what am i do twenty five confused here let's do twenty six first twenty six so there's twenty six those coordinates twenty six is here cross streets between it's on granite street between fort street and school street so fort street school street all right we're replacing the pole so it's going to be a painted pre mark and then we're always going to click simple and then this po checkbox here design investigator is going to be your contact name phone number case there's a question from the folks out in the field like which pole like i've been called a few times where you know ever source gas is out there marking their stuff and they want to know confirm which pole it is that i'm replacing or so on and so forth so sometimes you will get calls about that and then for the description of work i just try to keep it simple so we're doing pole twenty six so poull twenty six granite st and then i drop in my coordinates from up top and i'm going to list off all of the digging work that we're doing on this pole so twenty six is we're just replacing the pole there's no downgrounds that we're replacing there's no anchors or push braces so it's just replacing pole so replace pole and then we just want to describe well where the location is so i usually will list a location like what side of the road it's on and then you know what the nearest house is so i'm going to say poll on north side of road i've also started adding into my notes here on my e five the dig safe notes polls on north side of the road and you hear one sixty five to one sixty seven granitere here's my description of that nearest house address is going to be one sixty five one sixty seven max distance is pretty much always going to be five hundred for everything that we're doing because we're actually listing a specific set of coordinates okay here's the notification section so back to the form quincy' is a digafe member so they don't need a notification they don't need a notice of excavation tied to this work so we're going to say na n a and then we're going to do dig save member and what i'll do is i'll do file save copy as and i'll do dig save and do pole twenty sixth that's our twenty six alighty and then i'll move on to the next poll and so what i'll do now is i'll take this file and do a file save a copy change the number to twenty five it actually will save there we go and so now we're looking at the twenty five one and so twenty five has a separate set of coordinates so i'm going to go in grab that paste that in here i think we're using the same i'm to use the same address for the house so i'm going to do one sixty five actually really it should have been one sixty five slash one sixty seven i'll fix that after sixty seven plan it so i got my twenty five i got my coordinates now the cross streets is forth street and i think this one was parker so fort street and parker okay same what are we doing on this pole this is just a twenty five pole replacement we are replacing a down ground here but that does not change the method of pre marking so down here i got to change some information so it's going to go twenty five granite i'm going to grab the coordinates from above and then for the digging b i'm going to say replace pole and replace downround slash rod and then i'm going to say i have it from my five as well so it's twenty five yeah polls on the west side of the road southwest of the intersection of granite street and parker streets on the west side of the road southwestern intersection of granite street parker street there's your nearest address from before and now that's saved and then we would go on to the next and the next one until we've done all of our dig safes now i will do an nooe for this particular pole just for the sake of doing it again i don't need to actually do itless unless it says you know something other than dig safe member or it says fax or email or call or send smoke signals okay so we're going to do the noe example here so back in my folder same deal here i would do you know work order number three one two one five five six five three three one two one five six five threes up and of course i already probably have it open somewhere i do all right so we're in the nooe let's fill out the top city town is going to be quincy department okay so this is going to be which departments are we sending the notice of excavation to so my particular example again doesn't have any we're going to pretend that we are using see let's go to base state w email in fact okay we're going to pretend it's shirley so we are going to be sending the notice of excavation to both the water department and the sewer department so we would do water sewer here so water slash sewer okay telephone number so how are we contacting well water wants emails also a fax and there's a fax number and sewer wants a fas and then there's the fax number we really only need to update it update the top based on how they want to be contacted so none of them none of the neither the sewer nor water want to be contacted by phone so i'm not going to fill out the phone number okay fax number so water wants a fa sewer wants a fax okay so what i want to do is i want to add another line here so what i'll do is i'll grab row below and then insert and then i'll copy that record from above to apply that formattingow so now it's just a solid block so now we're going to list some fax numbers and then i'm going to break it up by water sewer so water so water wants a fax to brian goodman at that number so water fax i'll just put brian goodman in parentheses and for sewer it's aarnd to forge and there's your fax number there so sewer and aarnd to forge the name on that okay email well sureirley looks like it looks like we have to email brian that aarnd to forge and shirley water i'm just going to list all of these emails one is for sewer and then i believe the other two is for water so same deal here i'm actually going to make two extra records here so one two and then let's see i'm just going to copy these emails it's water sureirley like shirley water it looks like rhonda at shirleywater com and then on the sewer it's just the email for the a so sewer now i do i can get rid of the hyperlink on these let's click click click right click formx cells just i think it's just general we'll do it that's not what i wanted to do undo or is it is it one of these or you not a hundred percent sure how i'm going to get rid of that hyperlink there' there's definitely a way to do it i don't think it's a big deal that it's there i'm kind of spacing on how to do that i do know how to do it all right so work order number i' have to fill out any of the other things on here so we've got my town city what departments i have my phone numbers that are applicable i mean i'm sorry not phone numbers i have my fax numbers that are applicable and then i have my emails that are applicable so we're doing this example for the digafe that i have up which is pole twenty five which isplacing the pole and down ground rod so i usually like to have the digafe open while i'm updating my noealyze this so what are we excavating for so replacing a pole as existing pole that'll get checked and then we're doing the ground rod scope of national grid work well i just copy and paste this portion of my digsafe for i think excavation well i can just grabop grab it from here so i like to fill it out in the digsafe and then pretty much just copy and paste closest cross street or closest intersection i'll just do the and intersection and i like to cheat and copy intersection from the text here to intersection of granite we're this is okay granite and pucker and p haveod of fark it's going to be painted if we were doing an anchor here we would do staked and staked and painted okay and so this is where the sketch comes into play so we just need one for poll twenty five so i'm going to go back into this view going to zoom out a bit i'm going delete twenty six because i don't want it to show on my sketch for twenty five going to go to the baseemap view i can see some crossstreets here so i'm just going to grab my snip tool grab a screenshot of that going to edit and paint okay and then here i'm going to just add a north arrow that's a south arrow north arrow and then i'm going to label the pole and this is just simply eenty five and then i'll save this as jpeg this is going into that working folder and i'm going to call this one poleenty five noe and then i'll go into the noe that i just created and i'm going to go to sketch insert illustrations pictures place over cll this device wow it's really buried in there and then i'll go and find that file that i just saved to my local machine which is this guy and then i'll do poull twenty five noe that will insert the image and then what i can do is i can just move it around i'm just going to fit it in the sketch window here that little box so might require you to stretch it out a little bit on the bot so on so forth maximum buffer distance from centeral road to dig location it's mostly going to be side of the road i mean sometimes you'll have it'll be way off road so that's the only time we'll probably end up updating that so and now we're done with this noe and then i'll just do a file save a copy as noe and then i'll just do five and then so you're going to do you would do an nooe document for each digafe document that you do so in this particular case i'm doing four dig safes and if i needed to do an noe which i don't frequency because it was a digafe member this was just all in practice i would be doing also four noes' just going to get rid of that i don't need that anymore i guess i'll have to finish my dig safes after this now getting there's the requirement for the digsafe is a little it's added unlike every all the other cost you i mean all the other requirements are added either through right click adding or they're already there you have to add an optional to get the dig safe tied requirement into your job you have to go to file properties permits and then in this window you're going to select under the permit authority ds digafe and you're just going to hit the save button then you can close it'll refresh this view and that will create a six forty five requirement which is tied to digsafe you don't have to assign it to anyone you don't have to modify its status that's now in there you don't have to add any special requirements and storms tied to an noe if we needed to do one and that is going to wrap up my presentation for using the filling out a dig safe or dig safes and noes what i'll usually do before i forget is so let me find a job that i've done recently that has multiples is i will take the individual excel files and then right click combine them into a single digsafe pdf and i'll do the same with the noes so that way they're all you know because we used to have to upload individual excel files and then you might have like ten digaves and so it just makes a lot more sense to combine everything into a single pdf and i would do that for the noes as well and then any of the other you know the environmental checklist and un obviously already pdfs so that commences my recording about nooes and digsafes i'm going to stop sharing and i'm going to stop recording
