[0.0-999.0] all right looks like we're recorded in process of being recorded so today's meeting is going to be complex pole replacement cost unit review and anything else that potentially comes up i pk a couple other topics that came up over the day yesterday that we'll need to talk about at some point streetlights and ownership probably some more conversation about lightning arresters and also there's the new work management calculator out there all right so i' going to share my gis screen so everyone can see my screen and so what we're doing is we're looking at megan's application it's a light tower app in i believe it's in franklin massachusetts so this is what her e five is looking like and we got two pretty significant pole replacements we got double circuit spacer cable and then really this was the one that i was probably the most interested in because we got a we' replacing a primary riser which can be really complicated so i really wanted to you know start looking at these and megan i do love how you've set up your e five with your notes your column here with your edits and coordinates and all of that good information love to see that all right so i did confirm because i did notice that yesterday or the day before that an email came through from tim timer n pull it up here what was it but just mor i just i'm just sorry looking looking looking anyways there was an email that came up out from tim about potentially needing funding project okay here it is got so i was ccd on this and i was a little nervous because i was like uh oh light we're using a light tower app are we even going to be able to work on this application because according to this it looks like we're going to need funding projects for a bunch of these applications but thankfully it looks like it's a different application than the one that we're looking at because i was nervous there i was like oh no the app that i picked for my complex demonstration and it needs a funding project that we don't have but we do not need a funding project here here's just two polls so i'm going to go into storms and i just kind of i just went in to confirm that there was no funding project set because we complete the two fifty requirement is oh i'm looking at the wrong job i'm looking at the job that tim emailed about about needing a funding project i need this number all right ruby all right and so that always went to the geographical tab you know we've sent the job to gis we only would have been able to do that if someone went in and locked in the financials which we did using this blanket by the designer clicking this button that will in turn auto compleplete that two fifty so o five twenty five and that work order number it's going to be our gis design i can all right i'm going go to browse that opens up this window i'm going to clear out i'm going to go to i say oh nine twenty five work order number check it's actually o five i'm going to hit the play button and that pulls up megan's design open that up okay so this is a message you get when someone is already in the gis design megan is there any way you can save what you doing and close out of this gis design so i can get into this closed in okayady so let's try that again excellent so now we get this message saying new conflicting data has been posted consider refreshing recall that this refresh is not this one this is the whole design refresh which you go into file refresh design basically this is just pulling down any updates from gis master database and top and updating that in your design there was some sort of conflict that would say hey there's a conflict we can't update this and it will throw an error message and then you'll have to reach out to me and then i can go in and do the conflicts i think i showed someone i want to say it was john i think i walked through doing conflicts on one of my jobs just to show him what i was doing with it go ahead and press okay all right so we're going go the tricky one right off the bat to pull forty three and so i just grab that gis id go and find it all right so this is our pole with work and then let's look at the coordinates because the easiest way to look at it i think that was it all right okay so it's further down we'll do a little streak view here to see what we're looking at there's our pole the primary risers on oh boy where did i go like i went in the parking lot so all sorts of risers on this pole palm risers get your primary riser that's going up here up through the com space up to this point here and so what is this pole it's a forty when you're replacing it with a forty five the looks like the primary riser is going up to twenty eight feet and it's currently at twenty two feet so it's going up six feet and so they're probably going to need we're going to need to when we replace this pole we're probably going to have to add in additional material in order to get that riser to extend up to that forty five height here what are we looking at lots of stuff we got double spacer on e brackets and you have your termination bracket for that primary riser looking back up at it again we got the cutouts and let's see what that looks like gis and so there are your cutouts three twenty fives one two three okay now here are your lightning arresters one two three now those aren't in gis because these are those assumed arsters that are associated with equipment so when we actually go in and replace this primary riser these lightning arrestors will be built within those macros so those are on the termination bracket there's our three lightning arresters and then these funny looking almost look like little piece little toilet paper rolls those are it looks like one two and then get the third one over there those are the terminators not arnold schwarzenegger terminators but those are the terminators where that wire will go down into the riser and so on so forth and what it's protect it's being protected by animal guard that's what these little bubbles are so squirrels and things don't go and chew on those terminators and then we got power fiber up and then it looks like we go triplex on one side and neutral to the north because i'm looking the wrong way here no triplex to the north neutral to the south and that's kind of what we have here we got triplex to the north neutral to the south one thing that i would do is i would have connected these two together so it was like a continuous line it does stop you one i mean it's just a through bracket but one side is neutral one side is triplex so we're going just want to make sure that those two are connected i'm just going to make that modification right here let's see this is the what we're seeing in gis so this is the regular route so i'm just going get my trail that's associated with that line and i can just drag it snap and then update and that will get that to connect and then we have our streetl and we have a down guy streetlight and down guy so this actually has a lot of things that i wanted to talk about anyway so the streetl we look at our e five and streetlights are either going to be owned and maintained by national grid or they're going to be owned and maintained by the city or town that they're in you cities and towns usually go through a process of actually buying the streetlights and from national grid and so there is actually in the work order resources folder go into that opens at the bottom here there's a streetlight ownership and it's split by new england and new york and there's a couple different lists in here i think one of them i need to go and archive i think this is the one that you want looks a certain way this is the one that we want okay and so this particular application that we're looking at is in franklin and so what we're looking for is franklin on this list if franklin is on this list then franklin owns and maintains its own streetlight so these are all the towns that own or maintain their own lights and i'm talking about street lights only floodlights which you't really a little like square box looks like there might be one down here thought i our floodlight floodlight looks like a little box floodls are always going to be national grid own maintained so this designation only applies to the streetls themselves okay and so let's find franklin franklin is on this list which means that franklin owns and maintains their streetls so any work associated with this pole replacement with those streetls is actually going to be handled by the muni the description of work here only covers national grid work what is national grid doing well they're not going to work on something that they don't own they're going to work on only the stuff that they own so the streetl work is actually over in' like column p municipal attach and streetls so we're showing the streetl and then the actual make ready associated with that so that's being covered by the city or town as i there is one cost unit that we will always add it's a reconnection cost unit that's tied to reconnecting the light to secondary after it's detached or disconnected that's a cu that we will always use regardless of whether the ownership is national grid or the muni so that's why the streetlight work that we're doing here that's here is not in our description of work now a lot of times that's of the one thing that i'll check when i see streetls i always double check the ownership because we do have a lot of new people and i mean even people who' been around for a while you know still forget that there are lights that are owned and maintained by national grid and ones that are owned by the muni it's far more extensive to have the muni lights in massachusetts rather than new york i mean they are there out there in new york but it's more widespread in massachusetts there all right so and our lovely pole right well first things first is i'm going to do what i normally do and i'm just going to work through my realar world objects these are going to be the objects in gis that i'm going need to replace or show the action within within my work order trying to minimize this in a way that i can show both of them how about this okay cool so that description works there so rear world objects that we need to replace remove install so pole pole is going to be a real world object so we're going to have to replace the pole physically replace this object in gis a down guy a down guy is going to be a replacement okay that's a real world object we've been replacing those now we come to this next line we're transferring a cutout and replacing a fuse link that is actually not a real world object that needs to be replaced the arresters here now these arresters are associated with the primary riszer they're assumed so there is no arrester objects on the pole that need to be installed removed or replaced now josh has had a job yesterday i want to say in that in palmer i think it was in palmer i don't think he's on the poll but let's see i canem i remember exactly where it is palmer mass and then it was this mount dumplin road and so he had run into a pole over here that had lightning arrests that one that was this one and so he was replacing this pole and this pole had three lightning arresters there's no equipment on the pole so it wasn't really protecting anything specifically on the pole but we do want to add these two gis as real world objects and then i also had him replace them within his job and these actually will are likely protecting a load brake disconnect switch that's down the way or no it's actually an open disconnect switch might even be a load brake too but so it's protecting this piece of equipment the style sheet keep referring to it has a lot of really good information besides just the descriptions that works so you go to the arrestor and grounding it actually kind of gives you the example the scenarios where lightning arresters are getting installed and so the lightning arresters that i'm seeing on i was seeing on josh's pole are likely tied to the thirteen point six point four where disconnect switches require arresters to be installed on adjacent poles within three hundred feet i went and measured it it's around two thirty to forty so it's likely that these arresters were installed out of protecting that equipment down the way but we would want to show those on this pole because that's not really assumed as part of any equipment on that pole on this on our actual pole those arresters are a part of the riser so those are not going to be something that we're going to replace as a real world object the three phase riser yes we are definitely going to oh we got a question yeah i'm just curious whenever i still live in massachusetts i thought they did that for reclosers too where they would it's quite it's quite possible yeah i mean the i mean these are the most the four most common scenarios and so i mean i'm sure there's other scenarios out there but and i also like i just didn't want them to think that that's the only time it happens oh no oh no no no it's not just well it'sect it will protect disconnect switches well i think reclosers also will have a disconnect or switch associated with it as well but also some equipment actually has it associated with they're also mounted on the pole or onto the equipment itself so like i want to say like reclosers might have it capac not like there's major equipment that actually had the arresters boltci like mounted to the equipment and they're kind of assumed associated with equipment no i just i just didn't want them to think that this is the only time that they'll see that because if it's basically the only thing that's on the pole and there's no equipment it doesn't matter what's downstream they still need to account for it oh absolutely no i was just explaining why they were there like why like the reason why they were on the pole that's all i was doing with that and there are different scenarios for why arresters were installed i think one of the jobs i was looking at yesterday had a combination of these two where likely it was installed or no i'm sorry it was these two because i had dead ends so primary was dead ending so i had arresters for those two and then i also had a fused cap with arresters as well i find that we get asked more arrester related stuff in new york where well alex will you we're going to be replacing a disconnect switch or something and he's going to want us to add the lightning arresters and bolt directions and so on and so forth so yeah yes we lost adam i think he dropped but yeah there's going to be lots of situations we're going to have arresters i'm just kind of showing you guys why they were there why they were added out there in the field okay so the primary riser itself is a realar old object that we're going to replace the down ground nothing to replace in gis the spllices is probably the most tricky part of all of this because we're going to actually have to replace a section of primary and then the rest of this is transfers all right so first thing first we allll know this one do the pole so forty five two replace whenever we're replacing or installing or removing objects in our gis design we're going to be using these buttons up here the only time that we would potentially change the status here for reflecting an action would be if we were retiring something there is no retire object button up top so who is removing the old pole telephone and then i'll cycle through and make sure that i have the replace removed one as set by as telephone this telephone is going to be removing the pole national grid is going to be setting the pole now this happened the other day notice that my riser is actually hidden behind the pole the replaced pole you don't see one there and so one of the things we'll have to remember when we actually eventually export our sketches here is we're going to have to make sure that the riser object appears on top of the replaced pole so to do that because it's hiding behind the you kind of sort of make it out there if you zoom in close enough i guess but to do that you go into object control we're going to go into electric objects we're going to go to riser and then i'm just going to right click on it and then we have the ability to bring it forward orick send it backward and that's just how do we want to view it we want to bring it forward we want to bring it on a layer that's not like a level up from where the pole is so it's actually visible above the pole like such and this setting will hold true for the rest of the day that i'm in gis like the setting will be that way for even the future work orders that i might open in gis today but you're going to open this up again on monday and that will be defaulted back to hidden behind your pole so that's why i like to make a note on my e five that i need to bring the riser forward speaking of riser we're going to replace the riser this is a primary riser size we don't really know not going to update that this is kind of a contentious contentious that's the word something that we've been going back and forth with the national grid because they want us to like update this or survey to find out like the riser sizes and it's like well we don't really capture that information you know so we're going to replace the riser as well thing and then i'm also going to replace that down guy go into the down guy and got to go in and just change that to a replace we got to replacement replace remo on that all right so the primary riser now i got to send you guys something that i've been using i use to help me with primary risers sent and just go primary risers and i made this a while ago and then i've been i've shared it with people so you know i think i have it in my one note i'll open up one note i'll just do a search for primary risers and pole replacements risers and pole repl the right one for primary risers replacements ye right and then i will view zoom this in a little bit okay so primary risers whatever the primary arrangement is in gis is going to dictate how we're going to handle the primary riser pole replacement and i will actually let me email this to everyone here hey josh welcome thank you good morning start a little early because there's a safety meeting this morning i did see that did i miss anything good or i don't know i mean we've been about twenty minutes i think the presentation thirty minutes so you missed all of it you missed it all stuff's a super important part miss all the super important stuff ye i always seem to miss the important part and we're going we're going over this primary riser pole replacement right now and i was just running through the replacement of all the real world jects based on what was in the description of work we replace the pole the down guy the primary riser itself and i was also noting that there were three arresters on this pole though these we were actually looking at your poll from yesterday josh with the line arresters there and so this is our pole replacement that we're looking at the primary risers on the other side so we have the primary riser heading all the way up we got our down guy we got sellble spacer on e brackets you've got your the double cross arm that's where they're sticking the cutouts one two three and you have your lightning arresters one that our view i' go get over here a little bit more so cutouts one two three lightning arresters one two three terminators one two three terminators have animal guard and then we had the streetls oh you know what you missed you probably missed my streetight talk how streetls can be both national grid owned or uni owned and weermine how we figure that out there's an excel sheet on on the work order resources under streetlight ownership called mass customer owned streetling oh i have that awesome and then that opens up this table basically if your town is in this list that the town owns and maintains the streetls so any work that needs to be done on the lights tied to this work order would be written up in a different column in one of the communication columns and national grid would not be involved with that now i think you and i went over i can't remember was it with you where i was where we were adding that extra random connection cost unit cltps was it i can't remember who i was talking to with that okay so there like there's like a random cu that we'll have to add regardless and i'll talk about that when we get there so that's kind of what you missed i mean so we got e bracket primary spacer our fiber we got triplex going one way neutral the other and so i was just kind of going through the replacements and i was about to get into the primary riser replacement and that's where i was at with this one drive one drive one note thing that i put together looks like i put it together back inenty two so we're going to actually use the primary arrangement in gis to determine how we're going to handle the primary riser pole replacement and the most common one is going to be direct buried which is found by looking at the primary ug arrangement so how do we get there well ingis we want to click on this dashed conductor that's underground conductor and click on that and that tells me the arrangement is direct buried the other option here is going to be non metallic conduit and they're handled differently and it's and what's different is what we do with the splices what we do with the additional cable the additional cable that we're going to need to actually extend the primary riser okay so direct buried when the primary underground cable away from the pole is direct buried replacing the cable from the pole to an existing access point fires excavation a sweep and riser pipe are required for all risers install them blah blah blah so direct buried is eighteen dash two twenty there is also a direct buried option on the style sheet as well one of the things that we do find out find a lot with descriptions of work coming out of the design is that there's just a lot of copy and paste you let me find oh i got to replace a primary riser okay not even paying any attention over here okay let's grab this one and go you know without even acknowledging that well one's for primary risers with direct buried and one's for conduit and note that the difference there between the two is the conduit usually involves replacing primary like all the primary from the riser to the manhole that it's feeding whereas when we direct bury splices we're going to be just adding in additional material in the ground around the pole or potentially on the pole so oh wait i'm sorry greater than number two is going to be replacing the primary cables to the manhole number two cable will get spliced in on the pole for the cable and conduit all right so we're doing direct buried okay and then the description of work here is what we got now in the in our description of work it's kind of copied over and they you updated a few things here we got you know transfer non porcelain cutouts replace and note on the style sheet it says the xx is in blue and eighteen twenty five is in red those are going to be standards or sizes that are getting swapped out in the style sheet i do see sometimes where these descriptions of work come through and it still says replace xx k fuse link which is that you know we're not really going in and fixing anything but they did go in we got the arrestors they changed it to a three phase now they're calling to install a steel sweep and riser pipe and then direct burry splices but there's an extra note here if there's an existing riser pipe at the base of the pole installing a steel sweep and riser pipe is not required okay and so the riser pipe that we're referring to is this guy here that's like an eight foot steel riser pipe and so if we see one of these we're assuming that there is already a sweep and the riser pipe so i'm actually going to get rid of that portion of the description of work because o nope not that one this one because we already have a riser pipe and i'm assuming the sweep is associated with it now with the primary risers we're not able to catch everything and so these are going to be scenarios that we do get a lot of revisions back from natal grid where they might say oh you know in this case we probably should add the sweep or so on and so forth we're just giving it our best go with these so i'm going to remove the install the steel sweep and riser pipe because i've already determined that there is a riser pipe there the sweep is usually underground where like the riser pipe will end and then the sweep will actually kind of curve down and then go in the direction i think it actually curves down and goes in this direction and if we actually go into standards go open up nineash what is a good eighteenash one twenty six it's just the standard single primary riser eighteen one twenty six i had this issue before i need to open up the book i' trying to find things justure and i couldn't find it maybe it's because i wasn't actually looking in the book see nothing in there either there we go all right so this is just a standard three phase riser with fuse cutouts and so your u guard comes down to the riser pipe there's your ground and then the sweep kind of goes under so when we see the riser pipe we're assuming that the sweep's already there okay so to come back in here and that's the fun part so what we need now is we need to provide additional material to the crews to actually replace the primary riser and extend it up the pole and so this is the the underground primary the direct buried and if we go into the ug wires there number two there's three of them change this type to one c one one c is just one phase and there's going to be three of those whereas if there was just one record in hereessentially it would just be three one phase' just going to update those otherwise they're going to come out as undefined and we're going to have to go and fix them anyways we got aluminum two xlpe good all right so now what we need to do is we need to replace a section of this underground wire what we need is forty five feet we provide the height of the pole that we're setting that length so we need at least forty five feet okay so how do we do that good question normally what i would do is i'm going to find the actual route that's what the actual route looks like behind the scenes okay and so basically we're going to be splitting that actual route and this into into three sections and one of those sections we're going to replace to get that material but we need to somehow get both the existing route and the actual route to split okay and we do that with reference point right click clear my trail i'm going to go into object control and you' going to scroll down there's a reference point defaults okay so the type is going to be reference point okay so for whatever reason these are going to ask you require you the town tax district and the line number so line number is two zero eight three tax district was not listed so we can do a little where am i here i want to get that so we're in franklin three oh one three one one three one and then you'll need a number just usually just do one and clear that trail and so i'm going to pick a spot say there and i'm going to insert it and i'll change it to system okay then what i'm going to do is i'm going to zoom in real close i'm to select it go into the drag and basically what i'm doing is i'm just going to move it t i can soill it potentially snaps on the wire underneath and you can just kind of sort of see it h it see where did that actual route go did it actually drag with it hey amazing it did so uo move geometry all right so it looks like i've got that what did i do did i just mess up my actual route no i didn't right cool we got one reference point added and that's on our actual route for primary then what i'm going to do kind of a neat little trick here to drop a trail point in the middle and then i'm going to go to trail properties rail point and then i'm just going to drop another trail point here that didn't work point here and then i want to go i'm going to say fifty feet that's eleven feet so let's change this to fty point and then that gets us to basically that gives us the fifty feet now i'm a little concerned i don't want to are these called elbows we want to mess with those do we have fifty feet in the other direction point can we do perfect so that's the section that i'm going to replace and actually i don't even need i think a second second reference point because this is the section that we're going to replace i thought i was going to have to replace a section in the middle and then i was going to add a second reference point nip out that section and replace it but we're only going to do it for this over here now is the fun part why do we add a reference point and all this stuff well what we need to do is we need to split primary so you got to have primary selected and then there's a specials drop down and there's a split button but it's great out right now because what we need to do is we need to draw our trail between the center of that reference point which is sitting on the actual route and the existing route and then and hopefully i selected the right order or i got it right on the vertex because sometimes this will throw error messages where you maybe didn't click in the right spot so let's give this a shot split could not find a legitimate support object let's figure this out maybe it's the other waylit what am i doing wrong here is the vertex that's good and i'm going to split so i had to find the vertex and let me going clear my trail and so when you' hovering don't like i have my left mouse click depressed cl and so when i hover over eventiually it's going to say vertex that's the very center of that that's where the actual route is probably linked into so that's just an easier way of getting in there to your vertex so so i found my vertex of that reference point that is sitting right on my actual route behind the scenes connectivity of this primary riser and then i clicked on the existing route and then did a split and then what that did was that turned primary into two different sections this particular section looks like only thirty three feet so that's i really thought that that was going to be more so maybe what i want to do here is go back in undo the split reselect primary so it's showing that it's one entire object all right and then i'm going to instead of doing it that way and dragging i'm just going to select the reference point and i'm just going to drag it down kind of let's see there's segment do a quick little measure here not looking for i'm just trying to get the fifty feet here sixty one so almost here so let's see back into that's thirty eight feet i go back into my trail point and type in fifty and then move point that's about where the reference point should go so' going to get rid of it got my move i'm going to grab that and then i'll zoom in probably a little bit more now i'll take the trail drop a trail point in the middle got my vertex and then i' hoping i'll find my actual primary wire got to have the primary wire selected and then i'm going to do spl it and now i have a heck why does it keep saying thirty one feet i could have sworn that was fifty i'm so confused should be fifty right keep doing that's the second time this has happened seventy six close enough unless it's talking about the other one that's okay that's a hundred this one's thirty one we're going to go in and modify that value ourselves manually here all right so now i have this section split out we got messages coming up not from folks here so question so far obviously a couple little missteps there and then of course the question about well why is it still showing thirty one on the length when i've measured it as fifty's another issue but so i've now split this section of primary off and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to replace this section okay and of course when you replace it with these wires you have to actually add the wires back in to the new wire that we're installing here and i can't remember what the heck we're installing so i'm just going to select this guy out here and just going to grab one of these and do a screenshot just so i have those attributes because that's what we're going to update the new wires to so then i go back into my replace object for that section of underground primary and i'm going to go into ug primary there's the create new object and then what i'm going to do is just hit the defaults so then i just got to change it to whatever the settings were over here so two do this aluminum one one c xl e can tell you what hal what the half of these attributes actually mean fifteen k we're going to do concentric because that's what it was before phase neutral phase okay and then we just got to change this from install to existing just mirroring this with this and then i'm going to hit the blue insert button and then i'm going to do it two more times because we need three wires two three i'm going to come back in here now i got to change all of them to existings i'm sorry not existing they're installs so now we have our three installs of wires and an anod that auto generated tied to it that out of the way for now and then the last thing we need to do here is we're going to have to add a splice so we're going to be direct varyying splices going to be direct varyying splices and so there's actually a splice this is a splice actually that we're going to add somewhere along this primary wire i'm probably going to add it here here butible it's not visible under that reference point and then i'm going to go into object control and splice basically this is going to create a folder for the splice when we generate cost units so install number two installation is going to be well what are we doing with the splice well in this case it's direct buried we've verified that the arrangement is in fact direct buried so i'm going to install that thing now i'm to hit save because i think i'm ready to generate work records or i do that i want to double check the cutouts cutout installation because i did not look at that oh boy so the cutouts are accessible through this lead line you've seen these when you're looking at your poes some of these objects are going to have lines that will connect them to the pole and to the connectivity underneath you know behind the scenes the actual routes so the cutouts are connected the streetl the streetlight connection is actually this here so that's another easy way of selecting the streetl the leader line is also a easy way to select the cutout installation also you know i know transformers have them so if you're trying to select the transformer you can do that transformers also have a secondary connection which is what this line is connecting the transformer that lives on the primary wire to the secondary because the transformer is powering the secondary so all right so back here i wanted to go into the cutouts just to look so k links and they're all non force line okay so i think i'm ready to generate work records and i'm really eager to see what sort of cost unit mess this populates so we're going to create new all right and so there are my work point flags number one is the pole it has all the good stuff in it number two is just specific to the splice and number three is specific to the replacement of the underground primary wire select all of them right click expand all of them and then this is just what ended up auto generating so i'm going to minimize these minimize these i do want to look at primary hiser minimize minimize so lots of auto generated stuff here right and if we actually go back into that description of work and see what the designer call for designers referring to replace back to back double circuit spacer sixteen dash one oh six x two so i'm actually going to open up the standards i just want to look at what sixteen one oh six is f sixteen one oh six there we go go so sixteen one oh six is e bracket line seven to thirty to there is some line angle here as the pole crosses the road so that makes sense and then so we have the e bracket and so i'm assuming the back to back is just referring to the fact that you have one on one side and one on other on the other side okay so that makes sense well what auto generated sixteen one oh one which so one it couple above it is just max line angle sixteen degrees and so that probably just auto generated because in gis the line is straighter to that next pole rather than an actual angle as it is in the field because o gis just blalked on me click any buttons gis are you there so then i just click too much maybe and to be a fast quick clicker sometimes doesn't look like it's cooperating okay there it is just take a second to catch up so it probably through that sixteen one on one because if you look at the primary wires as they're modeled in gis it's a really straight line here and so it's going to autoenate how based on the attributes associated with the objects and then how they appear in gis so that's likely where that sixteen dash one on one came in that's not what we have out there so i'm going to just leave those probably going to end up deleting those okay and then the sixteen one forty two is kind of sixteen one forty two okay and so three way spacer cable main line with tangent bracket to cross arm unfused so this is just not even close to what we got here because this is kind of thinking that we have the spacer and spacers tapping off and going on to a tap but that's not happening here it's actually going underground so that's not actually correct either so i'm going to actually go in and delete those primary framing macros and replace this one with the sixteen dash one oh six okay so go into primary and i'm going to just delete the sixteen dash one forty two and thatll leadave the wire case we need it and then i'm going to go over here and i'm going to replace these ones with that sixteen dash one oh six now the way that these toss units are going to read here let's see that's sixteen one six and so the standard and then the size of the wire and so these auto generated based with the four seventy seven so i'm under the assumption that where primary is four seventy seven or it's cl those two let's take a look okay so there's one of our primaries is four seventy seven tree wire now note that with spacer cable that there's four wires within the child editor three are tied to the actual wires themselves and one is tied to the messenger that ends up kind of holding together everything so look back up here you the messengers here and then one two three the messengers up top and then that one's kind of a hard one to see i can't really see it but so the spacer cable has four wires that has the three hots one two three and then the messenger one two three messenger that's why these populate this way that's why the annotations populate that way it's just saying that you have one neutral wire that the messenger and then you have your three four seventy sevens what does the other one look like same deal so they're both four seventy sevens and that's probably why the sixteen one oh one four seventy seven version populated so we're going to replace these with the sixteen dash one oh six designer called for and i'm in agreement that that makes the most sense here so i'm going to do at sixteen dash one oh six uncheck that and i'm going to grab the four seventy seven and then i'm going to do the removal i don't particularly like removing and adding cus by selecting an existing one and then replacing it because then this window closes and then you have to reopen it to add the next one so i usily will just add cost units to this blank space and then delete as i need to all right okay and that one's the removal so what's inside these things all right well lot of random cost units that i'm not even sure what half of these are seext one oh six install and removal now we're going to need actually multiples because we have two of the sixteen dash one oh six i don't think updating the quantity is going to give the desired effect i think we're going to actually have to show individual poull top configurations so i'm going to go back down to one of these and i'm going to just add in the sixteen dash one oh six that's already in my design so i'm going to install one i'm going to remove one now we have the spacer primary setups squared away now the riser so the riser standard is eighteen dash four oh five that's being cited here go into this try to find eighteenash four oh five and that makes a lot of sense except that eighteen four five is for well no actually thirty five kv is maximum distribution so this could be used for you know distribution primary as well as subteeth primary it looks like but so you have your spacer this looks an awful lot like what we got out there in the field but one of the things you'll find is that gis doesn't have all the examples that you're going see in the standards manual so i don't know if we're going to be able to find an eighteen dash four oh five option in gis let's see put add and just for giggles i' just going actually it's just going to show us what the three phase riser options are for macros eighteen one twenty six two seventy three three thirty six three thirty seven three forty one fifty three no four oh five in fact there's no such thing as an eighteen let's see add eighteen four oh five here so there isn't a specific macro that we can add based on the standard that we're referencing here that's okay because we're basically just going to treat it like this eighteen one twenty six because that's going to have all of the stuff that we need related to this primary riser and that's probably one of the more common prior riser macros that we'll be using and then we'll just add the cost units remove cost units as we need and we'll still just cite the eighteen four o five so we're going to replace it we're providing whatever cost units that we can and they're going to build it to that particular standard and you'll find this quite a bit with new england especially with risers and primary framing especially when you're dealing with like major equipment and that the standard that we're seeing in the description of work doesn't necessarily match what we have available to us in gis so we have to do some bit of you know kind of i wouldn't say fudging it but you know taking what we have available to us and you know trying to make it work as best as we can and so the macro here i'm being aware of the time but the macro here has your lightning arresters this is why with primary risers they're assumed equipment becauseim the primary riser actually has the lightning arresters it also has a it has the cutouts as well though obviously the cutouts are associated with a different object here it has the terminations it's removing a ground couple grounds pbca is our cutout bracket pe twelve m is the you know basically this bracket here that holds basically the termination arm that's the no actually that's different no the pe twelve ms are believeave the brackets on the end of this because some of these will hold just one thing and then others will hold both an arrestor and go into that work description style no cost unit list it also has the spray foam here and then the riser you guide removal go back in okay so say pe twelve and thirteen so it's fiberglass mount for terminators for cutouts andrests and then there's just one of these can be used for onees for three phase and one for one phase and then the riser install has the same thing so what we would do here is we're going to split these macros so we can access the cost units within and i'm going to split the other one i'm going to stop there so we we can take a quick bathroom break whatever we need to do before our safety meeting i'm going to stop sharing does anyone have any questions what we've covered so far i suspect we'll probably just pick up where we left off later on after our meetings but obviously primary risers are scary and honestly probably the hardest thing you're going to do with work order so when is that meeting for everybody for sure it for everybody oh can you forward that to me please got it let's see thank you does anyone else not have the safety meeting invite i got it all right yeah i got it okay i'van you got it yeah got it i all right so looks like josh you're the only one that i've sent that over to you and so we're going to end up coming do we're going to end up coming back in here and then we're just going to be modifying cost units based on what we need to do the work you know i'll go in and you know update you know the brackets i'll make sure that my cutouts are all squared away and you know then we'll have to look at number two and three two is the splice it' like nothing auto generated there and then for primary wire nothing auto generated there so we got lots of fun ahead of us here but i will stop recording do do yeah now

TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] all right so now we're recording right and so i just want to pick up where we left off before the meeting we had just gone through and looked at the primary the overhead primary macros that auto populated and we reviewed those removed some of the ones that auto generated that were not correct and i think we were i think i had just expanded the risers to kind of show you what was in there so all right i'm going to go back to how i normally do pos because i want to keep it organized for myself so already done the primary so i'm going to minimize those i'm still going to keep those expanded because i do want to look at those wires and then we got sixteen one oh six so we got and i think i accidentally closed out of this location in maps okay right all right so let's just do our normal stuff at our poll going add our favorite cuto top cost unit we can also use this folder for other removal cost units you're not going to be able to add any sort of installs in here so let's go into i'm just going to go for my favorites go cut off top okay going to minimize that folder note that the poll removal is the dash jo that means that telephone is going to be handling the removal and then for the actual poll itself go in forty five two is what we're setting i'm going to go in and add some cost units i know josh yesterday we were looking at adding stuff to your favorites did those favorites save into today i'm not sure yet okay i' justious as soon as i logged in because josh was reporting that there was some issues with his favorites actually saving i mean so he took the time to put stuff in here and then when he opened up gis again it was gone it and i have run into that in the past with other folks so i don't know how i don't i couldn't i really enjoy having the favorites because you know everything is like right there you're not spending all that time hunting around for things so i encourage you to test out adding costumits to your favorites and then you know when you open it up the next day check to see if they're still there and let me know if your favorites are saving or if they're just disappearing and hopefully we can look to figure out what was causing so for the poll i'm just going to run through my favorites here we we've seen a lot of these going to same wele set it got my wi reflector got the ng tag at the pnwp which is just the labor associated with numbering the poes and then i'm going to add the pole stencils for the number and that's just going to be four and three install four and install three that's freaking out like it is but it is all right so there's our poll folder and i'm just going to minimize that come back into goinkle maps and so two three four five six so there's six spacer wires going through and then two messengers because each spacer cable has a messenger associated with it and so when i look into the primary overhead folder you'll see that there's actually a primary wire that's specific to spacer cable so you're working with spacer we want to make sure that when we're adding the primary transfers that we're adding the spacer version rather than just the regular version which is this one here so this one i'm actually going to get rid of you don't need that one because everything is based on the spacer so this covers one of the spacer cable setups because it's one on one side one on the other on e brackets so sixteen dash one oh six covers one side then you have your three wires associated with the hot primary lines that are getting transferred and then here is that neutral that a one ought spacer neutral here so i can minimize these and that that covers one spacer setup i' go on to scroll up here and so again we got the four seventy seven labor transfer for three so i'm going to minimize that and then we have the spacer messenger i can minimize that does that kind of make sense to folks i'm saying it alighty so next up i'm going to get rid of this luminaire actually' let me skip that i'll come back to that down guy so we remove the down guy and we're installing a new one and then there's the anchor and guy folder so the anchor and guy folder is always going to be tied to what we're doing with the anchor generally we're transferring an anchor we're not doing anything with it staying in the ground there's really no action associated with it so we can actually just get rid of the anchor and guy folder unless you're installing or removing an anchor itself that's just gets removed and then this is tied to removing whatever the existing down guy is it's just a labor adder there's no material there whereas when we're installing something new it has all the material based on the three dash one oh five so those are good tied to our down guy now let's look at secondary i'm going skip the riser the last here secondary comes through on just a through bracket granted it's neutral and triplex neutral on one side triplex on the other but they aren't dead ending so it's really just one wire and we don't really have a way of accurately showing that well it's neutral on one side secondary on the other or triplex on the other yeah i suppose we could add two but's that would probably get called out in review because we would have an extra transfer because it's on a three so what i'm probably going to do is i'm just going to assume it's triplex it's neutral triplex is probably going to have more labor than just the neutral so i feel like that would cover the most labor associated with transferring secondary so i am going to just use this cost unit for secondary slash neutral and that means i'm going to get rid of these two this one get rid of this one because that's just neutral and secondary conductor go in there and i'm going to change it from what are we doing for that our secondary here let's see replace the primary down guy okay transfer triplex neutral secondary tenash one hundred fig two a we're just going to swap out these dead end brackets for the through bracket with the angle it's a ten i think it's eleven fifty degrees something like that fifty five degrees go back into secondary and got my secondary bracket tied to eleven to sixty for the standard install that and go remove it and i'm going to come back in here one thing i point i did point out to josh yesterday just an interesting thing that will sometimes happen is that the columns in here get all sorts of messed up they get squashed it's hard to see and i also find that once you start futzing around in here with the columns that every time you open it up they'll be all messed up so i generally try not to ftz around with it but obviously it's going to give you trouble that sometimes so just as a heads up that yeah your columns are going to do some funny things sometimes i'm going to get rid of the dead end brackets or secondary because we don't need them and then this going to that covers secondary secondary is now all set and i'm skipping riser for now last my favorite for last okay primary wire so i think this probably generated related to one of the pole top configures that we had previously gotten rid of we've already got the spacer primary wires let's see's that one there and where's the other one there it is already got the messengers squared away for our spacer cables so this is just not needed going get rid of that and see there's my columns all squashed of course i really can just right click remove because i don't want it anymore but okay so that's that and that's that all right the risers so these were a macro and then we split the macro you right click on a macro and a macro is just going to be has the ma in the front or has the ampersand so you can actually right click and split to access all the costumits that's the only way you're going to be able to do any modifying to the cost units within a macro is to split them now one of the things that happens when you split it is that you'll lose your the anoe associated with this replacement when we go in and add our pole replacement annotation so if you go into here and you go to specials work order ano and that adds our forty five to install sixteen one oh six times two if i went in and split that and then re added the anode this line would not be there just fine we can manually add it back in if we needed to get access to it but i'm just making you aware that the work order anod the red and blue anodes that we add is going to be showing you know the pole and then the primary configuration as well so so splitting will have an impact potentially on that annotation not going to do anything with it so i'm going to minimize that and we're going to go to the riser so let's look at the pole here this is where we're going to be taking care of a lot of different things now i'm just kind of assuming that we're replacing existing i imagine they're going to probably replace this with whatever was in that eighteenash four oh five which is just a single arm probably aiber single fiberlip hard to say and i think so they're just going to replace what's in the field with what's already there okay so now going back to my description of work it says transfer non porcelain cutouts and replace fuselinks so when we get cutouts we are only going to be replacing porcelain cutouts usually they on the same appearance as the transformer itself if there was a transformer the non porcelain ones are usually darker in color in appearance and so we're transferring the cutouts in replacing the fuse links fuselinks are always going to get replaced whenever we're doing anything with the cutouts okay so if i go into my riser folders these are showing that we're the cc fifteen k apps is the cutout body itself that is this part you know it starts here comes down and goes over here that is the cutout body and then you have the fuse tube with the fuse link living inside that and then all of these are on brackets so we're transferring the cutout bodies because they're non porcelain but we're replacing the fuse links and we're replacing the brackets so that's what we'll always do with cutouts if we're transferring cutouts existing cutouts we're always going to replace fuse links we're always going to replace the cutout brackets if we were replacing cutouts we would replace the cutout bodies the fuse links and the brackets and of course the fuse link replacements potentially drives an outage list and actually because this is a primary riser primary riser replacements regardless of whether it's commercial or industrial i mean commercial residential will be an outage because these do take a while and of course we have this big big building here the boston group so they're going to have some sort of outage possibly tied to this work and it might be very expensive i i think i think the outage was like fifteen hundred dollars a customer something like that it might even be more for these larger commercial type places so it can get expensive and that might be the reason why the customer doesn't want to go forward with the work replacing a primary riser itself is very expensive remind the outage is associated with it but so back into the cost units so we're not removing the cutout body so this cost unit can actually get removed because we're not doing that action we're only transferring the cutout bodies so i'm going to come in here and i'm going to delete the removal of the three cutout bodies cc fifteen ks one is the cutout body i'm going to remove that i'm going to go into the riser install and i'm going to change i'm going to change the installation of the cc fifteen ks f to a transfer so let's just do it this doing it that way design and so cc fifteen ks one we're going to call that for transfer and then i'm going to update the quantity on that to three and then i'm going to delete the install columns are i want a look crazy here deleting that so now we are transferring three cutout bodies now we're replacing the brackets and we're also going to be replacing the fuse links the fuse links i'm going to confirm with the e five on what the size is on the fuse link so the e five is saying twenty five k fuse links pretty sure that's what gis shows three twenty fives well what auto populated well no fuse links actually populated there's no fuse links in this riser that populated so we can actually go in and add those so the removal the riser removal i'm going to go and select the object edit takes me inside the riser object to get at those cost units and then i'm going to go to add co i'm going to go to my excel sheet here let's see it's in the work order resources under here there you go that's the one that i gave everyone access to all right so i'm going to go up to the top here okay so there's your lightning orestors cutouts transformers do i not have fuse links in here does not look like i do that's kind of weird i know i have them in my favorite so add them that way favorites so cfl k twenty five is going to be the fuse link what's the description work say for that standard because there's actually's see's the' to say it's go into the work description style sheet and you go into gosh go into transformer get you this table which we might have already looked at before together this is just related to transformers now i realize that i'm looking at a these aren't there's no transformer here but i think i wanted to point out that there's also there's k link fuse links and then t link fuse links and of course t links are only for a very specific part of the state and usually to know the difference is that in gis it's going to say k or twenty five t we got the k links here really know the difference what the difference is between a k link and a t link but they use one in the brockton area which is actually where robert lonida is coming from that's going to be the new engineer for massachusetts taking over for robert collter and he's kind of in the process of that transition over and i know he's coming from the brockton area but we're really only looking for it in gis if it says k or t all right so we have the fuse link and i'm in the removal folder so i'm going to apply that and i'm going to remove the fuse links okay and then i'm going to go now normally i would probably just do all my removals together and then all my installs together so i'm not like bouncing back and forth but i'm kind of bouncing back just to kind of show you that we're removing them on one and then adding them on the other so i'm on the install and that's where i'm also going to add the c flk five that's the install so i'm going to install and i'm going to go in and change this to three and change this to three okay all right so we have three fuse links removed installed transferring the cutouts bodies and now we just need the cut out brackets which we already have pbca is just a cutout bracket on the style sheet i mean that's the style sheet the cu list just the cross arm standard cutout bracket they also can be used for arrestors as well if they were on the cross arm now some cross arms are going to be fiberglass and not a hundred percent sure if this is going to end up being fiberglass or not for that a lower arm i'm just going to basically treat it as a wooden one so i'm just going to grab the pbca which actually already have we're already removing three of them and we're already installing three of them okay so the other cost units here so in the removal we have just this grounding vertical we're just going to leave that there's also this one as part of the grounding vertical there's two of them for these primary risers i don't really know why that two populate or what the difference is between the two of them but i'm just going to leave those as is there's only going to be one of those per pole and we got the spray foam on both of the install and the removal so that's fine let's see got the terminations those are just going to get removed that's fine and we're also removing this is the u guard associated with that riser okay so what is left here all right so one thing i don't see where the lightning arresters' see anything about lighting i do see it here oh no right here there's lightning arresters there but those look like they're on the the terminator here the terminator bracket so that is going to be the see is the c list show for this primary riser alicia has a handy dandy and doesn't really tell us anything in there so what we're going to do is we're going to leave the termination there we're going le pe twelve m we're just going to leave so what we need to do is we just need to see this pe does the pe twelve m look like anyways and just leave those i think pe twelve fiberglass mount for cutouts and rsters three phase pe twelve m so assuming that one of those is just going to be this whole entire thing' going to remove one of those at the install on the other removing the lightning arrestor those look like they're on that terminator bracket as well i'm just going to leave those because they don't look like they need their own brackets arresters i think i'm good on the risers so kind of jumped around there so on the risers we're removing the grounding vertical well two different grounding verticals removing three cutout brackets the spray foam the three terminations basically the terminating bracket another ground vertical we're removing the four sections of u guard three lightning arrestors three fuse links and we're installing three arresters three terminations one of those u three grounding verticals one termination bracket one spray foam one grounding vertical three cutout brackets four sections of u guard we're transferring three cutouts and we're installing three fuse links so that takes care of that now the engineers might end up having us add you know you know swap things out based on the standard kind of use them to be the experts when it comes to priming risers because there's just a lot there that know we might not necessarily know abouter you know know that we need to consider it so i kind of just do the same thing over and over and over again with these setups you know it's mainly just what's on the pole what auto generates and then maybe add a few things here and there there's my risers now the luminaire so i mentioned this earlier so this is a uni streetlights because we determined that franklin was we determine that franklin owned and maintained its streetlights if you recall went into the work order to resources folder and then you go to streetls and then it's this one and then when we look at this list scroll through franklin is listed so franklin owns and maintains the streetls so most of the streetlight related cost units can be ignored removed now we do have an undefined we would need to get rid of the undefined but i want to make sure that we're adding this random cost unit that we need tied to the connection so i'm going to go into that streetl connector to select the streetl light okay and so streetlight brackets going add one you can do this right in your gis design just going to hit the defaults and i'm just going to go existing listing and then i'm going to go withinc and then i'm going go through and find that streetlight again and then go back to my point spin editor select work point one and then do the associate by map selection just that button next to the word and that gives us access to the luminaire which was where our cost unit is it also gives us access to the streetlight bracket t editor double click on this and then i can add to that folder and this cost unit needs to be in this folder or it's going to give you an error it is a some reason i have my streetlights under my primary pole top framing but it's the cltps which is just reconnecting the existing streetlight tas to the secondary conductor so when they replace the pole they're going to have to disconnect the light and then reattach it the new pole and then there's a couple taps that are tied into that secondary this cost unit is just tied to reconnecting the streetlight that's going to be the only cost unit that we're going to add related to the streetlight with these mi streetlights we would also add this one if we were doing national grid streetlights but we would also add all the other ones other cost units associated with transferring the bracket rewiring flex conduit replacement all that fun stuff so i'm going to just install one of these and that takes care of the reconnecting of that streetlight bracket go into that luminaire folder because i don't want the undefined we want to get rid of undefinesed or at least address them if they're associated with a real world object that was not so we've done work point one now i'm going to move on to worko two which is the splice and so for the splice i just use a general number two splice i'm going to go in here add and thankfully it shows it brings me right to the splice folder here and so what i usually will do is there's a lot of different splice options in here i'm going to put number two in the description because that's the size that i need is a number two related wire and then i can actually sort the description and then see all of the options and the one that i usually end up using for this is ho rink placeice number two no it's just that one the cc ss fifteen k two which is just for number two cable fifteen kv is referring to distribution voltages thirty five kv would be it's just transmission might even be subt as well generally it's the fifteen kd is going to be referring to the voltages that we're using so apply now we're going to need three of those because there are three wires going into the riser so three of these wires are going to need splices two three remove again toine and then i'm going to go in here and i'm going to add three on the splices now i just remembered that i need to add josh's favorite thing or john's favorite thing cable tagsied to the primary riser description work says tag new cables so i will have to go back in add those i just remembered it when i added the splice let's go and just finish up with these u guard so open this up and i'm going to go into the cl list and i'm just going to right click in the white space and we're just trying to find a cost unit tied to removing the wire again this is number two does how is it pop up is it just number two or is it just two one c three one c four two i think it just has two not with the number so let's see by code so two one so this is the one that i would use in this case because it's a number two wire it' aluminum or sl sal close enough and it's one one c referring to the phases whereas it if three one would be three wires bundled together into one primary wire essentially or individuals wires so i'm going to add this okay and for whatever reason this showed up as seventy six feet it's definitely some measurement thing going on with my measurements in gis because it says thirty one feet but it's actually seventy six so that's kind of strange now i am going to update the quantity to three because there is three wires and the install is going to be the same one the same cost unit it for my design you see this is the install and i'm going to do three on that one as well so we're removing three installing three wires and seventy six feet of the wire so i got to double check why my counts are not making any sense here as farres measurements it's going to trail properties i think i need to change this to that long length units and feet is that gonna let me do something oh it's all the way out there okay so let's see here sixty three feet but yet in gis it's just thirty one feet just so confused with that so what i'm going to do to get this number to show the amount that we want i don't want to have to go in and keep on splitting primary replacing a section so we can actually trick gis into getting us the right amount here and to do that going to go into the editor here and i'm to change the highway footage to fifty because that's well new pole is forty five so let's do eight are actually good five there we go you got to update the actual route and then the highway will will update automatically and then we can go into that point span editor and we're going to rebuild that work point i' going have to re add these cost units again potentially how is it on ninety now i'm so confused like oh i don't i don't really understand that's where that number is coming from why it's ninety and not why is it adding up is there multiple wires here this is kind of strange to be honest let's see unl it's just let's go back in and update this to four as well this is the replace remove one as well back in rebuild install is ninety why like it's almost adding how about if we change this to gosh fifteen i'm not at this point i'm not really sure what the hell's going on let's see what see and replace is the install so let's go in and rebuild we change that to fifteen that's close close to the amount that we want how about ten i don't understand what check i have to check with someone else back in here that get us fifty least fifty feet hey fifty five i'll take it i don't really understand why it's giving me that but you know we'll see and let's just change this to i think we said ten on these and i will definitely get back to every one on what i was doing wrong here or what was going on wrong here back in and rebuild see what happens with that add my removal of the same thing or remove ay fifty five feet oh we need three of them a little crazy there at the end with primary wire but we got there now we've got all of our cost units set for this now i do think that we'll probably get some suggestions and review tied to the primary riser as far as we caution's to add not add like right off the bat i know that depending on the reviewer we're going to ask about adding a there's a cover messenger cover up top here that's a separate little cost unit so i know that that might get asked for you and then they they might tell us to go a different route with the splicing or the lengths or i'm going to let them make all of those calls when it actually does get to review but that was that hole and that primary riser and i'm just going to takeick a quick run through make sure we accounted for everything and the description of work so we'replacing the pole same whole set we got rereplacing back to back d double spacer sixteen dash one oh six x two which we've got on two one two so we got those we're replacing the primary down guy we've got we're transferring the cutout cutouts and then replacing fuselinks we'replacing the arresters which lightning arresters are here this is actually a riser specific lightning arrestor whereas if it was just a free floater like the ones that you were seeing josh those free floaters look like personal those free floaters look like this cal twelve k wheres the risers have the r pne at the end what else got the arresters we've replaced the primary riser we've replaced the single down ground there's your downg ground we've direct bearing our splices we have our splices oh cable tags how quickly i forgot about our cable tags i'm still going to do that cable tag we got the foam seal here transfer secondary and that's one hundred f two a and we do have that so it looks like we have to add ourable i mean our tags for the riser so cable tags primary risers a little bit different than with just secondary our customer service risers so let's go into the open up my oneenode go to cable tagging for primary okay and so it's the same tag holders as we would for before except now we're going to be tagging each phase so in this case we have a three phase primary riser so we're going to have to add an a phase b phase and c phase we're going to have a tag for each one of them so we're going to have three of these we have one a one b one c we're going to have three of whatever the cable is going to in this case it's going to this pad add forty three dash one so if i go back into that one we're going be two transformer pads so we're going to have three of these and then we're going to be adding the numbers tied to that pad so i don't know if we have enough well so this the first six tags so that's one digit that's two and then four one two four three dash one that's six so i think we should be able to fit it all onto a single six digit tag i come in here i'm just going to drop these in my riser folder there isn't a labor adder associated with cable tags like there is for stenciling the pole the pole replacement i'm going to right click add i know i have all these of my favorites put in my riser folder okay and so i have my tag the cctn tag installing that i'll update the quantities in a minute okay what else we we need the the cup twenty one a b and c that's what these are down here so i'm going to install one of each of those okay come back into my note we need this two transformer pad don't think that one's hiding in there i think i have that in somewhere else or i haven't moved it in two transformer pad that needs to go into my risers i'm just going to select that and drag it up into my risers's location and now i have the that didn't even actually move in there's going to apply it so we got the two transformer tag and i'm going go back into the and then the cup twenty one n cost units for the numbers so cup twenty one n so we need forty three dash one so there's the dash and there's the four and a three and a one okay i've added all the costumes now i got to go in and update quantities because it's a three phase primary riser so we're going three sets of cable tags so make this bigger here so the tag holder itself we're going to need three of those one for each phase that means we're going to need three sets of these numbers so three of the dashes three on three of those three of those these we only need one of because there's only one a phase there's only one b and one c the two transformer pad is also going to be three take that i can send this one drop one note thing to folks this is what your tag is going to look like like that's the six tag holder one two three four five six and so there's our cable tags and then this is definitely going to be an outage sure customer is here and questions with any of that obviously the primary riser went a little rocky there at the end but commercial and all right let's roll on up to the other one back up to poull forty one forty two forty one on this one forty one looks like oh yeah all sorts of comms going on theround here looks like it's hard to look up and see but you got the e brackets on either side with a messenger for each one so w three primary wires for each e bracket plus the primary messenger for spacer you got the primary down guy this is just a cutout this is a transformer protecting cutout there's your transformer you have your primary bushing on the top you have your side bushings where the secondary voltage comes out with the neutral and then also transformers will have a usually the newer ones more recent ones will have tank mounted lightning arresters they are assumed equipment you know so assumed arresters so they're not getting shown in gis now if say we needed to install arresters related to protecting a piece of equipment all phases will need an arrester but this the fact that this transformer is hooked up to one of the primary wires that phase is covered by this arrestor if we were in fact calling to install them before you know one of these reasons outlined in the work description style sheet let it go got it here here it is so arrester so if we were being if we were installing arresters to protect the disconnect switch or something like that and the pole already had one of these arrestor on it one of the phases we would only need to install arrestors on the other two phases i guess like that so you have your cutout your cutout is on an arm that's actually a bracket that's bolted to the pole that's a little bit different than what we had before primary fiber i mean primary fiber power fiber which is likely the applicant here light towers usually does power fiber a lot of power fiber work and then you have your triplex that goes in one got our street glide so this one's a lot more straightforward than the other one also our riser is not a primary riser which helps you know the regular secondary surface risers aren't nearly as bad as the primary ranser ones are allright so back into my description of work identifying the rear world objects that i'm going to need to replace objects for got the pole primary down guy and we got the replacing the fuse links but those you know that's not going to be a rear world object that's getting replaced same with the down ground that's going to be actually a cost unit that'll auto generate in the transformer we'll have to replace the riser and that looks like about it the streetl is mi and it's in the municipal streetlight column so what are we doing here what's the customer probably another on the commercial actually new england telephone company might be just the that might be something on the pole or something that is going underground here that needs some power like a box or something hiding in here unless it's talking about that one twenty six the new england group doesn't say okay all right so first things first replace my pole doing a four twoty five two replace that's removing the old pole while telephone's removing that pole and i'll go in and just make sure that the setb by is telephone at this point the replace removed so telephone is replacing the riser object is on top of my pole replacement so that's good and then i'm just going to cycle through replace that also going to go in and replace the the down guy just replace that and let's just look at the transformer in the cutouts we got an existing ten k fuse link and that's what the design references these aren't always right and it's usually can be double checked by looking at primary voltage so thirteen eight thirteen eight also i could have gotten it from my e five as well so thirteen eight so we can go into the work description style sheet go to the transformer section and then you're looking at these tables down here the top table is tied to single phase transformer installations so usually just a single transformer can which is what we have out there in the field and then this bottom one is tied to transformer banks most of the time there'll be three transformer banks out in the field but there are occasionally we'll run into a three phase single can bank out in the field and whenever we're looking at transformer banks it's on each transformer tank kv size rather than the total size so when you see a transformer bank transfer it's usually you know some designers might put you know transfer one hundred no so seventy five kva transformer bank when it's actually three twenty five kvas so when we're figuring out the fusing we would base the fusing on the individual tank size not the total tank size that makes sense so thirteen point eight is the voltage for primary and our transformer size is twenty five k so i'm in the top table here so twenty five k i scroll down until i find thirteen point eight on the left here basically this bottom section from twelve down is kind of outside of what we would normally see some of these are subrmission voltages actually the let's see two two two two eight six and below those are a lot of the subrmission voltages generally we don't see anything that's down here we're only going to be primarily focused for here up all right so twenty five transformer size has a ten k fuse link according to this table thirteen eight is the three phase and then the single phase would be seven point nine so ten is the magic number which is what gis showed and it's also what our design showed so that's good right and since i'm in here tinkering and i know i'm going to have to add something tied to this streetl let's just go in and make sure that there's a bracket added okay got so i bracket just going to addinget always do that i always change it to existing and then install it and then it will just change it back to install and just never it's just a muscle memory thing now what is this this is a manhole so the underground conduit that's running through here so that's what this primary is there's primary running underground all through here plus i wonder what the primary underground is' thirteen point eight so you got three so you got one phase run underground or three phases of it running underground and then you have two up on the pole for spacer this is a very heavy industrial park area of this town used to work in this town ages ago it's actually not all that far probably twenty five minutes from where i grew up so familiar with where i'mat here alighty so i think i'm ready to generate the work records i'm done with these ones i'm going to minimize those compress them all because i don't want to see them anymore and distract myself or confuse myself what i'm looking at got the pole selected i'm going to hit the create new remember the rebuild here is your worst enemy when it comes to adding cost units because this will rebuild every single work point in your gis design and then you potentially have to go back in and you know update all of those again now if you did want to actually rebuild something you could one second my cat is being hey guys stop so if you actually wanted to rebuild a specific work point you could right click on it and rebuild again rebuild is going to regenerate the cost unit so a lot of those cost units that you added after generating might not actually populate so usually what i instruct folks to do is if you're going to rebuild something so if we were going to go in and have to rebuild this work point what i would probably do is i would expand it all i' probably minimize some of these macros because i i didn't go into the macros and then i would just grab screenshots of what i've already selected and save those separately rebuild and then just kind of so i'm not basically refiguring out all of the cost units i have them all listed here and then i can go back in and re add them so generally you're not going to have to do this unless you forgot to replace remove or install one of your real world objects that's when you might run into issues with this so i'm going to go back in i'm going to minimize all those and then i'm going to do the generate create new run yeah i' doing i need that and that will run okay and work point four has been created and we'll expand this okay description of work then we're back to that sixteen dash one oh six which actually is what populated is great and down here as well so those actually populated correctly have a gun i gott to go take this away from my cat she's going to shred it i need those those are notes for work all right so my normal process here pole cut off top for usual minimize that and go in i'm going to add my same whole set for the new pole and along with all of the cable tagging that i might need as well so going to go to favor set on the new pole the white reflector and i have them all like right here in the same folder so it's just a matter of down the line add them and then what was our poll number poull number was forty one one and four one forty one okay going to minimize the pole folder now i'm all set with that so let's look at the primary so we said back to back sixteen dash one oh six is which is what we got there and that's what auto generated that covers one side this covers the other we also have the four seventy seven spacer primary which is what's there out there in the field looks like you got the four seventy seven and the oneaught messenger on that one and then on this guy we got the four seventy seven and the oneaug messenger so four seventy seven spacer primary transfer with the two framing minimize that and then i have the primary wire folder for the messenger so that's good that covers one of my primary pullt top configs for that spacer here's the other one installing and removing the pull top config transferring the four seventy seven and then we're also transferring the messenger that takes care of that primary pullt top configuration let's see anchoring guy we can get rid of that folder because we're not replacing any anchors that we're removing the existing down guy and we're going to be installing a new one so that's pretty good okay streetlight bracket so this is a cu associated with transferring the streetl bracket but the transferring of the streetlight bracket would be handled by the owner of the streetlights which in this case is at national grid so we're going to basically replace this with that reconnection cost unit that we were adding before so i'm just going to add because it needs to be in the streetl bracket folder it's going to throw errors install that and get rid of the actual transfer of the bracket there's our streetl light going to save the transformer for last here so for the riser just going to remove that cost unit that auto generated so if we go into that cost unit just to see what's within that so you know what you don't need to add here so let's just go in and so this is just a connections so let's go in to oh look at that it's already there so we're just trying to find the one phase transfer four hundred a know why is it showing up as trans there see here oh boy there it is okay so this has all the materials in it so even though it's transfer it's it says trans in the description here it kind of implies that we're transferring something it's got the materials all associated with it it already has the u guard so we don't have to go in and add the u guard as a separate thing to the replacement of the customer surface riser so this removal and install covers the bulk of what we need for the riser object itself and that will beplace now we will still have to go in and add roll riser tag and that spray foone and remember where this one was going this one was going to an unknown wasn't a lot of information about the customer here rop street doesn't have an actual address here it says new england telephone company wonder if we can see box't really seeing anything that it might be i mean for all i know it's going underground into the manhole one of these manholes maybe it's going here it might be going here be honest it's probably going there but i don't really know what the heck the address is so i'm just going to assume that they know what the address is and that the stencil associated with whatever the number is is probably on the truck but i do want to give them the basic stencil stuff go into that riser i'm going go into that and i'm going to give them give them the the six inch the six digit tag give them the customer owned tag and then i'm not going to give them any numbers because i don't know what the number is and i'm not going to just start guessing on what the number is sor i mean the transformer the tags associated with the risers are you know i feel like they're probably on the truck but so i'm not really too worried about adding those numbers here the last thing i am going to add is the spray foam and the spray foam needs to go in a riser folder or that will throw you an error if you add that to your pole or something else it will that will throw an error when you try to design complete or send estimates to sts you'll get one of those red flags i'm to install that okay there's my riser install and i've already minimized the removal and then what are we doing with secondary here secondary is just on a through bracket ten one hundred fig one which is what auto generated here so i'm just going to minimize that last but not least is going to be the transformer which is a macro and so in order for us to update or interact with the cost units within we need to splip it so we're going to right click on it and split so whenever we're working with the transformer there's going to be a transfer cu for the transformer itself which is this tv twenty five k one sixty nine is the primary code and so that's the transformer and that will usually be in there or sometimes it'll come in as undefined but we'll need to have a transfer of a transformer and then the mount as well associated with that transformer what else are we going to have we are going to have that's not the mount that's the transformer cutout i have to look at that i'm not sure what that is this is the transformer mount tms what this wrong with want cutout racket mount okay so that's just the cutout bracket for the spacer that i think is just this the bracket that the cutouts on here so that'll be our cutout bracket so transformer and then the transformer mount and then we'll have the cutout you probably transferring the body replacing the bracket and the fuse link and then we'll also be replacing the grounding vertical it's going to be usually the same types of cost units whenever we're doing the overead the transformer installation transfers okay so let's see the transfer of the cutout body is okay we're going to need to replace this not going to be transferring the bracket associated with the cutout so i'm just going to do in there add go in design scroll through there and thirteen m i'm going to do an install of that and a removal is one specific for spacer cable setups and then i can get rid of the transfer okay fuse link going be replacing that cost unit there don't want to transfer the fuse link i'm going to go in again and have it in my design already so no sense going and bing it again cflk pen we're going to do an install and removal okay and then i can get rid of the transfer csvg is the downground that will get replaced as well the downground and rod rod goes in the ground so if you were just replacing a downround on a pole that's actually digging work but all right what are they doing does csvg design csvg going to install one i'm going remove one and i got a trick get rid of the transfer and so now we have the have the transfer of the transformer we're transferring the cutout body where also have the transfer of the mount we're replacing the cutout mount or the bracket we're replacing the fuse link and we're also replacing the downground and then just to verify that i have everything you know pole back to back on the primary transformer fuse link cut out downground transfer secondary looks like i got that tag we got the cable tags from what i know and then the foam seal's that's all we got there and then i would probably compress all of that and i can probably go in here and add my annotation installing to sixteen dash one oh sixes we're removing to sixteen one oh sixes drag that out of the way as well i needed two and i'm going to save this before i hit a button that i regret hitting and that takes care of that pole so now we've finished replacing those two poles those two fairly complicated pole replacements second one was a lot easier i mean the pole forty one was definitely a lot easier than the other one but i mean when you look at this block of text you go there's a lot of stuff that i potentially need to you know and so just break it up in little pieces and if i mean the first thing is always to make sure that you're familiar with what your real world objects are what you need to do with them with the job you know that will save you down the road from getting all the way in through your cost units only to realize that you missed the replacing the riser or something like that and you end up having to regenerate everything so still not really sure what what's going on with my primary wire here why the measurement shows one thing and that i had to put in i had to put in a height of a measurement of ten feet in order for the cost unit to populate as fifty five feet like i'm not really sure how any of that works is working out right now but i'll have to look into that any questions comments concerns st i got nothing yeah it's a lot there a lot there let's see here i want to just look at these poles so that one's got all kinds of stuff going on we got the double spacer and then we have a primary taap three phase tap off the top just one stuff and i think the other way i think i saw transmission lines the other way or sub t or something down in here and so this is something we always want to be aware of we always want to be aware of where the subrmission lines are or transmission lines are in that they're noted on the five of course our app starts way the heck back there so i mean it's not really applicable but the concern is that when we replace or we call to replace a pole that has overhead transmission lines or subrmission lines that we're going to be decreasing the clearance between phrase primary and then the crossing transmission lines and so usually what ends up happening is that we'd have to send someone out to actually very interesting we'd actually have to send someone to out to get the measurements i can't remember what equipment they use john have you ever had to go and do a t line d line crossing and then in your time or josh anyone from the field i've spent a little bit of time in the field but not further would you say again did you have you done any t line d line clearance the field for you were doing out when you were going out and surveying and doing field stuff yeah i had to do a second pass work where we we had to measure the height the mid span sagging heights of those primaries and then the mid span sagging heights of the sub ts for a primary height because there's like you talked about there's certain clearances you need you can only go so high exactly a lot of times what ends up happening is that these poles will end up getting you know if they come in and they go okay well we got to replace this pole with a five foot taller you know for whatever reason well they're probably not going to be able to do it you know they'll have to go out and do the you know that clearance analysis but generally'll probably just tell the applicant look you know it's unlikely that this is going to get approved you know it's unlikely because the sub transmission group will have to then weigh in and say okay well is this okay or not you know and so oftentimes we'll just say hey look applicant you know you're going to have to bury you're going to have to you know attach on one of the previous poles and then rise or down go underground to make it through this subrmission or transmission crossing because we are not going to be able to replace these poles another thing you got to think about too is that that the transmission lines may not even be owned by national grid so there might be some sort of you know coordination between you know austin maybe ever source or something like that up there's that subst transmission that substation which is around this corner here down there another thing that's interesting is that let's see let's see forty seven it's right there i think where is that forty eight forty six and a half so then this is forty seven okay so this is also that's forty seven so this is what they call i think they call it a gateway pole or a getaway pole or something like that it basically the first pole out of the substation so this is where the line comes out of underground from the substation back here so you can usually see that where it's all going underground to the sub and these are pain in the butt to replace generally they would not get approved it would require all sorts of outages and it would just become a big mess so you know sometimes we just need to be aware of where we are in relation to things i have seen jobs come through to us in work order where we're trying to replace one of these primary riser polls and not realizing that hey it's right outside of one of these substations it's the first poll that's coming out of the substation or going into the substation and those aren't going to get potentially replaced so we talked i dropped some comments or notes in the chat earlier about lighting arrestors oh the new work management calculator so we did finally get that pretty soon you guys are going to be working with jobs that you might have to use that now i don't know what folks are doing for their local folders you know it's your local folder but so you're going to want to make sure that you have access to at least both the twenty twenty four and the twenty twenty five work management calculators i keep them in a standard folder that i'll then copy and paste and then rename as my application so i always have them there and so there is the new checklist the twenty twenty five i i'm sorry the work management calculator for twenty twenty five and it's a lot different than what we did with the previous versions of this and so that's what this that's what this looks like and we've probably touched upon this at some point or another because we've all submitted jobs so we've all probably been plugging things into a calculator probably the twenty twenty four calculator that we were looking at before but now we have the new one twenty twenty five and it's a little bit different there is now a second tab here at the bottom where it actually has some information about you the fields in here so we're working in massachusetts and so these remarks are going to actually go in storms we'll going to copy you know whatever the applicable totals are here and i would just control c that and then they'd go into storm's remarks and we would probably add a tpg remark paste that information in there and these totals are based on what we enter over here so this is a little different the total polls on the application so and now if we go back into the info i learned this yesterday total polls on application includes canceled polls non licensed polls non billable polls so any poll that was on the application so there's only four here so that first total is going to be four there's that pla total that i didn't really quite get a straight answer on in the meeting but we would check lci to determine the count on the plas the pre marks would be based on you know are we replacing a pole are we installing a brand new pole or we installing or replacing a push brace or a anchor these are all things that we're going to have to go up in the field and either draw a big white x on the pole when i say we osmos will have to go in the field and draw a big white x on a pole or they might have to put it at stake to not where we're putting this anchor so we would count those there if we go back into the other f marks are really only for billable work only i don't think we've had apps or i think maybe we have had apps now where we've had a mix of billable and non billable redesign time we're not really using unless we're doing hourly stuff there is a job that i was going to assign out that will be a rework or revisions where we originally wrote it as a no make ready application and it's now a single pole replacement so i think any of the time that we spend working on that will be accounted for using this redesign time field rather than what's going on up here admin fee is going to be your total number of polls requiring billable make ready work so that's just going to be two for this application and of course i'm just going to make this up there was two pre marks because we had two po replacements and i'm just going to say there was eight or six plas and then our police protection total would be coming from storms which actually still is open and working apparently i don't know if you can actually update it but you actually still get into it but the police protection would be based on you know whatever the totals that get sent back to storms from gis usually i would go in and access that through file properties reports and then you go to bce which will give you the breakdown of costs on billable non billable so billable added service non billable system improvement and then standard cost is the default billing assignment that the cost unit gets when you first add it into gis and so maybe i would have a police protection total for billable work and then a police protection total for non billable work but so yeah there is a new calculator now one of the determining which calculator to use we got to go into helix we got to look for this add to q field and so but i'm going look at yours megan also i would definitely update this district number if you can find it and then the city state here on your working on your ei that we eventually submit to national grid you don't want to leave those ones blank okay all right and so the add to quue date for your app was seven twenty three twenty five so april first or later twenty twenty five we're using the twenty twenty five this is going to be the calculator that you're going to use to determine what costs to put into storms related to the writing of this work order trying to think if there's any other topics i can cover i think that's all i got for now did i record this i forg no i am recording any questions now i'm going go grab a lunch and i'm going to be here until probably four thirty if you have any questions or want to go over stuff want to grab me to look at cus or you want to talk about documentation or you know maybe a couple of you have some questions and we can all work on things together you know whatever you guys need just reach out let me know yeah and if i don't talk to you have a good weekend and if i don't talk to you megan have a good vacation next week thank you appreci the ha leisa enjoy your weekend yeah thank you you guys too thanks you thanks so muching a

VIDEO_ID: GetDocs into STORMs - OneDriveNotSyncing.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] all right going to run through a quick little tutorial on the plan b option of getting documents into storms when onedrive isn't syning correctly so i'm trying to get these two documents into storms i just uploaded them today and i went into storms to upload those and in my national grid gis docs folder there's nothing there those docs aren't there it looks like there's some kind of syncing issue going on between onedrive so how do i get these docs into onedrive so i can then upload it to storm so i'm not waiting around for onedrive to figure out how to sync itself so the trick is inside storms go to browse and pretend you didn't see that because i'm going to get that there but go to desktop google chrome right click open that's going to open up a new window you're in a google chrome a version of google chrome that's within the same server as storms here so you're going to go into the top here into office three sixty five and i'm probably already logged in this is going to be my national grid this is my national grid that's my national grid location here i'm going to go to onedrive and then i'm going to go to my files gis doc and you'll see that there are some updates here i have it's like construction sketches were uploaded twelve minutes ago and we have the ei that i've been looking for so they do show up in onedrive here but they don't show up in onedrive when i go to upload them into storms the normal way i would go about doing so so to get them into storms you go into this location on the national grid onedrive here and you go to the little dots three little dots next to the file click on that and you go download and we do the next one which is the construction sketches you go download on that okay and so this is downloading it not locally on your machine but on a download location on the machine that storms lives on so now you should be able to come into here and find those files under quick access download and then from there you should be able to upload them so this is just like the workaround for getting documents into storms when your on drive is not syning

TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] hi everyone i'm gustavo gaspirin brazilian jiujitsu instructor under the great fabrico verdun and you are watching jiujitsu for damage so what is brazilian jiu jitsu jiu jitsu is a grappling based martial art and self defense system created by carlos and eio gracie when they modified some techniques and philosophy of the traditional japanese jiu jitsu although brazilian jiujitsu focuses primarily on grappling and more specifically on ground fighting it is a comprehensive self defense system that includes striking techniques throws and stand up techniques and strategies against surprising attacks like most martial arts jiu jitsu can also be practiced as a competitive sport the rulle set will vary from tournament to tournament but generally striking techniques are not allowed in sport jiu jitsu and you can practice it whether or not you are wearing its uniform which is called gi or kimono a legit brazilian jiujitsu black belt instructor should be well versed in all aspects of the art gi no gi sport and self defense now let's take a look at how jiu jitsu works jiujitsu is a comprehensive self defense system created to allow a smaller weaker person to defend him or herself against a bigger stronger and more athletic opponent by using proper technique leverage and most notably taking the fight to the ground by closing the distance and taking the fight to the ground your opponent's ability to strike and inflict damage are greatly reduced the strategy consists in taking away your opponent's strengths and ability to win while you applying your own the longer you stand and trade punches with someone who is bigger and stronger the higher their chances of hitting you with a damaging strike the stronger your opponent the harder they will hit the bigger the opponent the more damage they can take and the longer the reach is so they can hit you without getting hit superior reach and powerful strikes are both mitigated when grappling on the ground jujitsu's methodical self defense and fighting system and its application can be broken down into four phases phase one closing the distance and clinching with the opponent phase two taking the fight to the ground phase three achieving a dominant position phase four finishing the fight so now let's take a look at those four phases starting with phase one closing the distance learning how to safely close the distance against someone who is trying to hit you is definitely one of the most important aspects of jiu jitsu the goal is to create or find an opening depending on what type of opponent you are facing if you are going against someone who is very aggressive and is moving forward trying to hit you half of the work is already done since he' helping you to close the distance just make sure you time it well and cover your face to avoid any unexpected blow if you arere facing someone who is more conservative and is trying to pick his shots you might have to take the initiative and throw some strikes to distract your opponent while you close the distance closing the distance is also one of the main differences between jiujitsu for self defense and sport in sport jiu jitsu you don't worry about strikes when closing the distance and you are facing someone who is willing to grapple with you as we discussed earlier taking the fight to the ground is an important part of the system that's how you mitigate your opponent's superior reach and powerful strikes there are many ways you can take your opponent down after you have established the clinch including leg trips hip tosses upper body takedowns and lower body takedowns taking the fight to the ground and keeping top position is the primary option in a real fight situation since most of your opponent's strikes from the bottom position are ineffective but it's not uncommon for jiujitsu practitioners to choose bottom position when taking the fight to the ground a technique known as pulling guardpecially if you are having a hard time executing a takedown knowing your opponent's instinctive behaviors and immediately adjusting to them is what will make you succeed from the bottom position pulling guard is common in sport jiu jitsu and the bottom position is without a doubt one of the most sophisticated parts of the game as a practitioner of the art be equally skilled on the bottom and top positions the next step after taking the fight to the ground is achieving a dominant position which will give you great control of your opponent through proper use of body weight distribution leverage and gravity a dominant position will not only allow you to set up your attacks but also limit your opponent's escapes and potential of doing damage we have four main positions in jiuj jitsu the guard side control mount and the back ninety percent of the time you will find yourself in one of those positions they follow a hierarchy with some positions being more advantageous than others so let's take a look at the guard first the guard is the ability of using your legs to manage the distance control and attack your opponent while fighting off your back the guard separates jiu jitsu from any other grappling based martial art there is no martial art in the world with a guard as developed as the one we have in jiuj jitsu a good guard will not only allow you to defend yourself against strikes but also execute reversals to come on top and finish the fight there are many types of guard you can use depending on how you manage the distance between you and your opponent but the three main guards are closed half and open each one of those three guards can be subdivided into many more as we talked before keeping top position is the primary option in a real fight situation but if you end up on bottom the guard is your best friend the guard is a dangerous position with a plethora of attacks and reversals in constant evolution especially in sport jiujitsu where you have the freedom to create new moves without worrying about strikes side control is the first dominant position you should look for when you have top position your goal is to get around your opponent's legs aka passing his guard and achieve perpendicular position in relation to his body making it difficult for him to recover his guard from there you have many attacks especially in sport jiujitsu where you can also use the ge jacket as an offensive tool in a real fight situation side control is mostly used to is smotn and hold the opponent down while looking to improve position into the mount or back controls there are also different ways you control your opponent while in side control the main ones are chest and chest kazugat tummy reverse kazugatummy and north and south the mount is the second most dominant position in the jiujitsu hierarchy it offers great control of your opponent and a multitude of attacks in both self defense and sport jiu jitsu the main reason the mount is such a dominant position is that you can inflict great damage via punches and elbows with little to no risk of being attacked back because of the rich advantage from the mount often your opponent will turn his back to protect his face or escape making things worse for him in sport jiujitsu chokes are the equivalent of punches if i can't choke you from the mount i can definitely punch you the back is the most dominant position in jiu jitsu you have excellent control and your opponent can see where your attacks are coming from the more he tries to punch you the easier it is to choke him out since he is not defending his neck the back control is the end of the line positioning wise you only go back to side control or mount if you are losing control of the back stay there until you finish your opponent after achieving a dominant position and establishing control of your opponent the next step is finishing the fight with either a submission hold or strikes submissions can be categorized into two groups chokes and joint locks chokes can be further classified into air chokes and blood chokes air chokes are executed by compressing the trachea which leads to asphyxia the compression can be applied using your legs or arms blood chokes are executed by compressing the carotid arteries cutting or limiting the blood supply to the brain which could cause unconsciousness or even death if the hold is maintained for a prolonged period joint lock submissions can be applied to any joint of the human body by forcing the joint to move past its normal range of motion let's take a look at the application of some of the most popular submissions in brazilian jiujitsu starting at the wrist joint wrist locks are applied by hypexttending hyper flexing or rotating the joint wrist locks can be hit from almost any position moving up to the elbow joint the most common attack is the arm bar causing the hyperextension of the joint shoulder joint kimuras omoplatas and americanons are the primary attacks against the shoulder joint and rotator cuff neck cranks can be applied in a variety of ways attacking the neck in different angles most common submissions are the can opener and the twister banana split and crotch ripper are the most common attacks at the hip joint at the knee joint we have knee bars and heel hooks as the primary attacks last is the ankle joint where toe holds and straight ankle locks are the go to submissions alright guys so this concludes our jiujitsu for dummy's video hope you guys like it please check our website for new cool content and also subscribe to our youtube channel

TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] right i'm going to share my screen going to go over compiling the eo n or the exchange of notice documentation we'll use the ein for joint own pole replacements joint own anchor replacements and joint own push brace replacements usually to trigger that information to get added to storms correctly we want to make sure that the removal poll object and gis i have a poll where's my poll there it is has the dash jo on the removal and also that the poll shows that telephone is removing the old pole and electric is setting the new pole whenever you replace a poll you get a little message pops up and it says who is removing the old pole and because joint own poes the joint owner which in this case is going to be verizon will be the one responsible for removing the old pole and national grid will be responsible for setting the new pole so the e when basically just explains that to the joint owner and explains which poles are being replaced and shows what costs if any the joint owner is responsible for so so i have on my application i have three pole replacements and so i'm going to go into storms already gone and sent my estimates to storms so i know my gis stuff is already in storms you can see ours are filled in here first thing i would recommend doing is make sure the two seventy requirement is assigned to yourself doesn't have to be completed just needs to be assigned to yourself what that will do is that will actually add your name to a couple of these documents that we're going to be exporting out of storms rather than it's saying third party attachment group so to get the documents out in storms you go to file properties reports and then that leaves us with all these reports and so the ones that we're worried about or we need to actually export are going to be these four documents the eom page one and two and the telephone ones so these four reports we're going to have to export out of storms okay now the first one i would recommend looking at and not exporting just taking a look is the page two and this is just how i verify that my polls are actually in storms i don't know how many times when i was early starting this process you you get in here ready to create your e n and then you realize that you're missing one of your polls and then you have to go back into gis and figure out well why isn't the poll showing in my e n and so on and so forth so before i go and export anything out of storms i make sure that all my polls are in in the in the exchange of notice page two report and sure enough i had my three polls listed and that's the only those are the only polls that i had on this application that we're being replaced so all that information is there good so let's export these reports so it's modify we just hit the printer that opens up this little window and we just hit ok and this is going to save to the national grid onedrive for storms okay and so how i usually name these is the this is going to be l it's electric page one and whatever the work order number is so three one two one five six five three l one not required to name them because we're just going to take those files combine them together into a pdf i just like to export them with the name so i know which is what page two modify print window pops up again okay this is going to be l two for that work order and then i'm going to go into the tellel pages modify you know you're looking at the tellel pages when it says request for telephone work at the top here go print okay deal here this is the tellel one so i'm just going to add a t to the beginning here tell one and tell two why is tel two only showing oh no it is done i' going to say why is tellel two only showing two poles but it's throw showing three tellel two okay now we've got all of the storms documents related to the eon out of storms minimize this and now i'm going to go into my storms onedrive launch and storm stocks and there they are and what i'm going to do is i'm going to move these to my local folder that's just the gis drive i need to go into a loc folder for my application and i'm going to copy paste now i was lucky here where onedrive was actually syncing correctly earlier today it was having issues with onedrive syncing and so there is a process there's a separate video that talks about the steps involved with getting things into onedrive or exporting things out of oneedrive when you know things aren't syncing correctly all right so i have my four files here and i'm going to combine them all into a single pdf which is what we needed the factor bat for and then i'm just going to go ahead and hit combine let that run okay and what i'll do is i will do a file save as and i'm going to go into the granite street and i'm just going to call this e n work okay so the way this document works is that you have a page one that just basically gives you the explanation summarizes what is going on on this particular street granite street we're doing three replacing join on poles okay there's an area that we'll put our sketch in and then this is the electric sheet two which it's just talking those poles work code a is installing mutual height and this is what we're installing new what electric is responsible so we're installing a forty five fifty fifty and it's showing costs here i go to the next page this is the telephone now you'll note that there's actually multiple pages that populated for granite we got off pole twenty one gr granite street without a route code and we have granite street with a route code so i'm going to go with one that has the route code are those other two pages don't need them and so now my telephone page has the page two that goes with it talking about the poles that telephone will be responsible for telephone is going to be removing these poles so now the pages are all set up now we'll have to go in and do some editing now there is an area for sketch and i'm going to make that in a second i want to point out that when we went in and added the two seventy requirement this is what ends up getting updated whereas if we didn't go in to do the two seventy and assign that to ourselves this is just going to say third party attachment or third party representative i can't remember what it is specifically but oh no don't tell me bad timing my virtual session is going to be logged off in nine minutes this is not good okay well so hopefully that does not happen so what i'm gonna do now first is i'm going to create those sketches now now i think of it this is local so it really shouldn't impact me getting logged off the server it's going to kick me out of gis it's going kick me out of storms it's probably because i've been on since like six and there's no like oh well wait i'm here let's i'm working don't close it it's just going close so i'm okay with that because i've already exported things out of storms and just going to make sure that things are saved closed so when that does close out i'm not like wondering well what happened to my work you know all right so so now we have those three poles that are being replaced now in a previous video i walked through creating my digs excel file that represented my digging work for this particular application i created from our csv basically a csv of just the poles that are digging work now there is a poll on this app where we have digging work but we're not replacing the pole and that was poll twenty two where we were doing a we were just replacing the downg ground rod and you that's not an e n item it's only for replaced poles join owned poles join owned push brarases join own anchors be on here so i'm going to delete that and actually i'll just walk through it again so i had that saved and then i'm going go into my google maps and so i have a gmail account i'm not sure if this is possible without a gmail account but so i go to my saved maps go to create map at the bottom create this will give us this window where i can do import browse this is dig csv okay this is just asking us well which field do we want to use for the coordinates well flat and long are there and then on structure numbers i'm going to label that as and so now here are our three poles that are being replaced now this is in a case like the dig safe where we have to be aware of cross streets or anything like that we're going to be creating a sketch for all of the pole that are being represented on the e n in one sketch all these poles will end up in one sketch i'm just going to pull it out a little bit and maybe i'll go back in a little bit more and i'm going to go grab my clipping or snipping tool and i'm going to just draw a big box around all of the poles then i'm going to edit and paint and paint open and thenm going to drop a north arrow here now i do need to label these poles so what is it twenty six twenty five and then twenty so pole twenty six going to be five twenty all right so what we're doing is with this sketch we're basically adding this voltage and reason for work line to the bottom of the sketch itself so we don't have to go in and update that ourselves manually and so the voltage what we will do on the bottom is we'll include the voltage the reason for work and then we'll list the engineer's name which in this case is going to be robert colter and his phone number okay the voltage is going to be what the voltage is of primary for these three poles so let's just going to go into the ei for this and i'm just going to pull out my pole replacements and so thirteen eight seven nine thirteen eight thirteen to eight okay so i have a little text note sticky note at the bottom here and i have a line that has my seven point nine seven let's see seven point nine seven thirteen eight okay copy that out of my little sticky note here and then i'm going to paste this on the bottom like this might even make it a little bit bigger there we go all right and then the other thing i'm going to add to this is sketch and then the application name and third party attach request so again i have a sticky note i just got to copy the application name into it so that's going to look like this just says sketch third party attach request and then the application name and i'll just slide that somewhere where you it's somewhat visible i wouldn't go crazy with this this is just very quick and dirty all right so there's my sketch for the eon that i'm going to use so i'm going to save this as and let's see e n sketch now my sketch is set so back to the pdf i'll screen this and all right so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to hit the edit pdf it appears on the right side for me i think for folks it probably is going to appear up there for you so i'm going to add text on the very first page of the e n document and only the first page you want to add and you want to make it bigger you want to make it pretty pretty big but you want to add the following prepared by whatever your name is company that you work for your phone number and i'll make that a little bit bigger okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to add the sketch that i just created so add image you and sketch and then i'm just going to click that into place and drag it over across so then it fits into this window for us i copy that past that on this sheet too same deal so the sketch part is done and now it's just a matter of going in and updating this information in here okay so the costs are always going to be zero unless the poll is non billable to the applicant so the if it's a poll replacement and it says yes in the bill to the applicant and these costs are going to be zero if it was pec if maybe national grid replacing the poll for whatever condition reason then these there's my error session has expired is okay that's where me for a loop here so if it was pec and national grid was replacing it then the costs would be split between the electric company and the joint owner which would be telephone we are zeroing out these costs because the applicant is actually paying for the replacement these costs aren't really don't really reflect i think actual cost they're just numbers that in their system it you know populates as such i don't know how where that twelve forty comes from but all right so i'm going to do is going to turn those into zeros so i'm just going to get rid of the one twenty four part lp zeros okay we also want to add since there's no telephone company tags that populated here i'm just going to paste in n that's fold i don't want that fold maybe i'll make it a little bit smaller then i can just copy that t t so this page is all set zeroed out the cost and we've added no tag or nt to the telco company if we had noticed that there was a telco tag when we were doing our gis edits and we updated gis with that then this number probably would have populated and not overly worried about you know making sure po number telco poull numbers are updated i wouldn't update telephone number telco poull numbers based on the e five it's all about visuals what we can see in the field so moving on to the telco sheet now the electric one auto populates a three under item four here on the telco sheet nothing auto populates so we just have to add a three thirty four three there sketch is already present and those costs are still are already zeroed out so we'll just have to go in and add p and now our e n is complete and you would have a page you would basically have four pages for every street that you have joint own assets being replaced poles anchors and push braces so that we looked out in this application granite street was the only street that we had with poll replacements and so we only ended up with four pages in this e n but i mean i've had ones where' had thirty six pages in here so depending on the size of the app number of poll replacements this could be a hefty document and then i' just just going to do a file save as back into the granite street and i'm going to just do e n whatever the application name is so now that is saved and then i'm just going guess i'll have to go back into storms but let's see here i just wanted to show you as i've done with these other videos what the requirements were for the e n and then i also wanted to show you something to look at in case you need to i lost my train of thought i lost that it'll come back oh i know so sometimes with the e n so we'll actually compress or keep the e n from populating that's one of the things that we'll do when we do our final tasks it's easier for me to just show you then talk about it here let's open up of course i unlck it we do oh man do this one and then it's going to open up storms oop does storms automatically open up for me hey it did awesome so the requirement that we need to add is added through this add optional requirements and if you scroll to the bottom of this list there's an eight forty requirement i'm not going to add it right now because the well the minders of the a forty are really quick and i don't want toload i don't want to add the a forty until i've uploaded that doc but so i would add this well let's do it one and then i would modify it and assign the requirement to just leave it assigned to myself but normally we would just assign it to ws telco and then the minders of the eight forty requirement will pull that down and eventually complete it i'm just going leave this assigned to myself because it's not ready to assign that requirement and then the other thing that i was going to point out is that one of the things that we're going to do when we have pole replacements is that if you go into your calculate costs here you'll see that there are actually the way that storms is taking all this cost it's actually minusing thirty seven hundred dollars and thirty seven twenty out of that cost tied to the pos that supposedly verizon is paying for but we just zeroed out all of those costs so what we need to do is we need to zero out these costs and to do that in your window here we go to service details and then we'll zero this out called tellelgen joint number and we'll put a zero there then i'll hit the save button and then i'll come back into my costs and calculate on pc and now those costs go away now when you have this button clicked when you have this set to zero you're not going to be able to create an e n so if you have to go in and update your e n for whatever reason maybe there's another poll replacement or something you'll need to come back into the service details tab remove the zero to get the e n to populate again so and that is going to be the end of that presentation i'm going to stop bearing and i'm going to stop recording

VIDEO_ID: Setup and Updating Construction Sketches.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] right i'm going to try another one of these presentations this one or setting up your construction sketches and running through that part of this process so i've done my all my cost units and now i'm ready to move on to do my construction sketches so and go to the plotting tab and i'm going to go to add construction plot that will create our plot name with a one through ten range at the end you're going to select that plot name and you're going to go into the little toolbox here under this results section it's called edit construction plot so we're going to click on that now open up this window and this is where we're going to make some of the changes that we need to make to the to the plot to point out let's see where what we're actually updating i have our set of construction sketches that i can pull up not much on there but so what we're doing is we're updating when we're updating the information in here we're updating what's going on on the this little side bar here the i if they call it header footer i don't know what they call it on the side but we're updating this up here come into here now i'm going to say get rid of the range i don't use the ranges unless i have a set of construction sketches that has multiple indexes you know for this one it's only probably going to be two or three pages so just leave the name as the gis design here no need for the page range here feeder number well i've noted that on my e five i also have it right here so one w one zero if there are multiple feeders so you can always put multiple here it's kind of a minor thing that you update here job title that is going to be your application name so i have that in my e five i' copy that in sometimes you'll get error messages where there's a space issue in this field i can't remember how many characters that the limit is but if you do end up with space issues related to adding in a job title you can always pair out some parts of the application name default by default national grid will actually add the applicant name to the front of all of the application names so that's something that might be able to be trimmed out again this is just this that small section on the right of all of the construction sketches so that fits tax district or town code this is the number that automatically defaults here is going to be your national grid district that's the whatever that barn is associated with this particular work the tax district is actually on the five which is this four digit number here zero one two nine also if you do not have it on your e five you can always do a trailo and do the where am i tool to figure out you what tax district you're in and then last but not least go to this description box here and i went in and just clicked on the three little dots cleared out this information so this is going to be kind of like that description section at the bottom of the sketches or the side of the sketches here we're going to put the city and the state so you can see and then i'm going to just count the totals of work types for this so i'm just going to go in and go okay how many pole replacements one two so three pole replacements and then for simplicity i'm just going to lump in the primary and secondary together into a category called just powerm ready and so there's two of those so three pole replacements two powerm reues don't have to worry you don't have to go into the description and go i've replaced six services and lightning arresters and down guys it's just the count summary of this work type checklist on the bd five so there's also a very limited amount of space in this window i usually will leave a space between the city state and then what the description but like literally i think you could type you one to three i think that might be the extent of this box anything beyond that and the text is going to fall off the edge of this description box here just going to be mindful of that here i'm just going to let see what is it remember is three pole replacements and two power makereadyies or okay so two power makereadyies three pole replacement three pole replacements and two power make ready easy toasy so we have our little deltas here so it means i have to actually lock these edits into place going to do that by clicking on the yellow button all right and then when i click off of the plot name on the first page that range goes away and then all the attributes will show there okay so now we're going to go into the first page we got to go in and set the scale on this page change the view scale to that's the standard size sketch scale that we're using and then when we do that it creates the box in our map view and then i'm going to grab that page over here on the left here and i'm going to move my cursor over and you're going to notice that the cursor changes into this points in all directions so basically this point you're able to click and then move that box around as you see fit so what i'm going to try to do here is i'm going try to get all of our pollls with work onto these sketches now i do like to do this with the work point flags on just so it gives me another aid as far as what areas i need to show so with our scaling there's no way you're going to fit all of these poles onto the same app i mean the same construction sketch sheet so it looks like these three poles will probably just go on one and those two on the other so i've just kind of positioned it in the center here you i've also i'm thinking about it like okay there's a street name up here that maybe i won't have to update you know i have my cross streets all of that fun stuff then once i'm happy with that first sheet we want to add a second sheet for up here and so what we're going to do is we're actually going to copy this plot i mean plot this box basically and so we're going to add additional pages that mirror the scale of this box to do that you want to select the page over here and then you're going to grab your trail point and you're going i'm just going out of ha it right click clear the trail from the previous trail that might be hiding in there and i'm going to just drop a trail point about where i want the center of that next page to be and it looks like i needed to actually click the plot name over here rather than a page and that gives you access to this construction frames from trail button and when we click that it will drop another box with the same scale that the previous one has and then you could update and adjust how this shows as you want and i mean that was really it on this one there's really not i mean there's only those two pages here and i'm okay with how everything appeared right next step now that we've got those pages locked in we want to add an index regardless of how many pages whether it's one page construction sketch with one poll with like little work or a monster project we want to be including indexes to add an index select the plot name and then under design parameters you go to the plot type index map electric and then you go under this modify frame section there's a construction create index and then that creates an index and we can select that index and go to the edit construction plot now this is the same idea we're going to go in and we're just going to update the scale of the index so i'm just going to round up to the nearest hundred here so i'm going to say two hundred and i'm going to hit the save button re so now we've set the sketches up but we can't actually hit the review button because what we need to do is we need to generate the maps and then once we click the generate maps then the review button will become available generate maps oh no i already have the layout open okay so i'm going to close that i already have it open the previous design so i get that plot name selected i'm going to hit generate maps that will run for a second and once that is finished the review button will become no longer grayed out and then i'm going to hit this review button that opens up the layout view in a separate window and the way i like to do this is i like to you're going be you're going to need to be able to see both the main map window and the layout view so you want to kind of position your screens in a way that you can actually work on both like i need to fix this slide that over here move that there all right and so now i have my sketches and i will try to make this bigger i realize that folks are going to be watching from a other thing here but alighty so next up we're ready to start updating these sketches all right first thing i'm going to do is on the index i'm going to add a north arrow go insert element north arrow i' just going to drop that at the top left hand corner and then i'm also going to add to the sheet a text box that represents my i'm going to put my contact information tied to the sketches so one of the things i'll do is i'm going to set these i'm going to set the attributes for this text box here to what i want and then i'll copy the text box to the other pages so i'm going to go to enter text here properties and i'm going to go and go deletion osmos uutil it tes services andally four six nine two six okay going to change the font from plane to bold i'm going to go size to five vertical alignment is going to be top i'm going to do an outline color of black and a fill color of no color or no white all right and i can modify that you don't need a legend on the index sheet note that how the description here popped up i added one space between the city state and then the power make ready and full replacement so so no legend on this page first page so i' do is i'm going to go in and i'm going to add a north arrow and i kind of just do this methodically i usually add the north arrow i add a legend and i won't really get too hung up on how it appears yet and then i'm going to grab from that index the text box that i had already previously set up copy i'm going paste that over here we're going to be using this text box for our description of work we might have to add an additional text box depending on what the descriptions of work look like i know that we got a couple pole replacements here and they do tend to take up a lot of space so i might need to get creative with that so let's do the descriptions of work here so i have my e five open and i need twenty seven six and five twenty seven twenty six and twenty five so going to go into that text box now whether you have this centered or left i kind of like to do it to the left then come into here and the first poll that i'm going to be adding to the is twenty seven you or it actually probably would make more sense to twenty five twenty six twenty seven kind of like the order that if you're working from top to bottom or whatever i'm probably overthinking it at this point but so first poll with work is going to be pole twenty seven and then so i'm just going to come in and do pat twenty seven granite three and then the line number four four four two zero i use the same format every one of my description of work items here and i'm going to paste the actual description of work from the e five into that text box okay now i'm also going to include police protection required if there was tree trimming there was no tree trimming so this is just going to be police protection required and i actually have a sticky note because you know you end up using add police protection required or tree trimming required all of those things we add those to the description of work so let's see here so i got my police protection required note and i usually put those extra notes at the bottom underneath the work i've seen folks do it this way where those notes go here doesn't really matter to me as long as you're consistent with it so police protection required and i' hit okay just going to let that stay there for a second so there's twenty seven next is twenty six so i'm going add a space and pole twenty six granite three same deal line four four two zero and i might as well add twenty five while i'm here because i know twenty five is going to be in there so i will do pole twenty five granite and then space down here okay so then i'm going to grab the twenty six description to work which is just this bad boy twenty six had tree trimming and police protection so i have my little sticky note down the other screen where i can do police protection and tree trimming i also put coordinates on all the poles that are digging work because i will use those coordinates at various points down the road where i do my dig saves or some of the other documentation so i usually like to include the coordinates on the construction sketches for my digging work i think we need to have at least one pole a page with coordinates when you're thinking about it so if you have a page with just pm ready on it you know just pick one to add a set of coordinates to but now we got the twenty six and i added the tree trimming and police protection and then twenty five and twenty five is the same deal tree trimming and police protection so now we have all of our descriptions of work for these poles i'm going to also grab the coordinates i usually throw the coordinates in my working e five that way i can just copy and paste so twenty five is these coordinates and if you go down and tree trimming okay looks like i need tree trimming i got it there it looks like it's just tacked on the end there so that's twenty five twenty six twenty six and then no coordinates for that one so i got all my descriptions of work now and then i can now see what it's going to look like in gis of course it's this giant blob of text and i'm going to keep on moving it around to see what i can do to get it to appear the way i want it to it looks like it's we got like half the page actually that works all right so it looks like i do need to clean it up a little bit like i don't want like pole here is kind of off the edge i wouldn't mind you know pulling this down to the next line so i'm going to there go to properties and then i'm just going to make some minor modifications to my descriptions of work so i'm going to kick the resulting in the next line and then under poull twenty five i'm going to do the and fuse link is going to be on the next line as well and then those changes were applied on the fly and i'm pretty happy with how that looks awesome so now i have my descriptions of work really can't tighten that up much more than i already have it's kind of like we're at the max here as far as descriptions of work goes for a page so i have my descriptions of work and then i have my legend now we got to add the other elements to the sketch so i'm going to add my cross streets my street name labels all right so parker street is here you can kind of sort of see it underneath my north arrow but i'm just going to add a blue ano that so it's a little bit clearer do that with the electric construction note and so i'm going to justop clear trail draw our trail along there go to object control electric objects and then electric construction note then in here i'm going to do status install we'll make the ano blue and then i'm just going to type parker street and we can check to see that that change has been accounted for and it has okay that's what we got so we got this street here that's fort street i'm going label that just clearer to see it with the blue so if i'm having any trouble at all seeing like a street ano or the full street ano on a cross street or an intersecting street i'll add the blue so this is fort street okay and i got to label the street that the work is on as well here i think i might turn this into two columns so you can go into the legend and change the columns total so you can then maybe stretch out the legend on the bottom of the sheet rather than having to take up a vertical box here so and actually that gives me so there's granite street okay i like that legend now what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to open up google maps see here maps also going to grab coordinates from the e five just so i can get myself into the right area because i just want to visually see the cross streets or the streets here so fort and so the next street this way is going to be school street let's minimize this come back in here so you can just sort of barely make out granite street i'm going to overwrite it and i'm just going to put install and then granite street and then i'm going to use my little carts to point in the direction of the cross street or the intersecting street so it's going to be school street to the sth west here and there's no need to add the one to the right because you can see fort street label here and then our cross street or intersecting street on the other side of the work is visible here as well so i have all my street names now as well i'm going to probably slide that over a little bit so it doesn't look like it's somewhat hiding underneath my legend and so now i have my streets and my descriptions of work and my cross street now i just want to go in and i want to make sure that everything looks visible my anodos are accounted for yeah and everything looks clear so these red and blue anodos for this go for this pole and then just slide that up a little bit again i'm just bouncing back and forth between my main window and my map window so i can very easily come in and make these changes let's see here i kind of want to move these anodos closer in over there what i'll do is i'm just going to one of the things you know you got to be careful with when you're in here trying to make selections is that when you come in to actually grab something that you don't inadvertently select the frame and then move the frame rather than the elements within the frame so like if you just came in and you're like all right i don't want to move this label over you might accidentally select the whole frame that you're in and then you go to move it over and you move the entire frame over and you don't want to do that so you accidentally catch yourself doing that you want to go to edit undoo geometry to fix that so back in here i just wanted to move these over i'm just going to use the shift click to select these two anos shift click shift click and then i can drag those over here it is it thinks that i have the ano here the ane associated with that street let's see i'll move po twenty seven ano a little bit maybe so it's down here so it's a little bit easier to see i'm also going to move some of these anos around just so it keeps the case i have to add a tree trimming it's hard to read anything when there's a tree trimming symbol there that one looks okay i do still need to slide this up a little bit more okay so we got pols twenty six seven five wait oh yeah twenty seven is here twenty six twenty five right other elements well let's see we have we have some pole replacements and we have work that's in the primary zone we want to make sure at least one of the primary spans is showing annotation and i went in while i was doing the job and added all of these anos you i and i added multiple because they were actually four three different kinds of primary so it just it was easier for me to make sense of that that's good and then we also need to have a feeder voltage per page as well so to get that added i see one way up here but i want to add one for the primary down here because this might be a different feeder so you always want to be careful you always want to be you want to try to grab the voltage feeder for a primary span near where your work is that's good and then where am i going to stick it i'm just going to stick it in this white space up here so i have the primary objects object selected and i'm going to go in i'm going to drop a trail fine and that's how the label is going to populate so in the primary overhead field here on the left i to go to the feeder number annotation and click the create and that will create my feeder number and then same thing for the line i mean the line voltage i just create two dots and line in how i want the annotation to appear and then you go line voltage boom and then last but not least on this sheet is the police protection i mean i'm sorry the tree trimming twenty six and twenty five add tree trimming now i made notes on my e five earlier so twenty six has tree trimming to the northeast and then twenty five has tree trimming for service and looks like i just noted just on either side of pole so i like to go when i usually capture all that information when i'm either doing my gis edits or i'm going through and you know doing my cost units you know that way when i'm at the point where i'm ready to add the tree trimming symbols i already know where i want to stick them so pole twenty six it's going to the northeast here right so pole twenty six is here and i'm actually going to double check this because twenty five is also got the tree trimming too i think they're probably both the same so if we come in here i'm referring to this but also we're working on this pole as well so both of these this tree here is probably related to both of these poles so i'm just going to add my tree trimming symbol in the middle here related to pole twenty six and then for pole twenty five i'm just going to add another symbol here and then one for the service okay so to add the tree trimming symbols i'm going to do go to brain part here oh my gosh really and gr my gosh that's not this is embarrassing i think oh you know what it is hat hat i'm not looking you don't add tree trimming symbols in your map view you add it to your layout view so that was the key there we go okay so insert element symbol and then i'm going to just draw a box where that symbol is going to appear and then i'm just going to select from the symbol name drop down here and i'm going to go tree and we want the tree trim ins and that's what ends up populating and then i can actually zoom in a little bit more and i'm just going to make this a bit smaller out and see what it looks like and i'm happy with that just about a little bit bigger than the pole and then i also what did i say twenty five was on either side and service so'm going to grab this and i'm going to copy that paste that over here because that tree trimming for pole twenty six was actually closer to pole twenty five i'm going to add the symbol there and then one more tree trimming symbol for that service now this one i'm going to make a bit smaller because it's kind of hard to see and then and if i took the labels the anos off i mean the worko flags off this is what it's going to look like twenty five i'm also double checking that my anos for these join on poles the removed by tell should be listed because telephone is removing the pole so everything looks looks pretty good here next sheet next sheet is just two poles same process insert fararo insert legend go into my index grab well this way grab my description of work from the careful accidentally selected a tree trimming symbol i grab the description of work text box here so copy that copy paste and now what we need is we need the descriptions to work for twenty and twenty two so let's see twenty two is down there and twenty so we'll do twenty two and then twenty so i'm going to clear out everything first po pole twenty two granite street line four four two zero and i have that description of work here and my there's no tree trimming here it's just going to be police protection let me grab my police protection note and then paste that in there that one has digging work i should probably grab those coordinates so twenty two pretty sure this is my pole yeah two you'll note that i often i i will always double check coordinates all right so i'm going to paste these coordinates into my v five so i have them coordinates i usually fill in underneath the street name and i'm going to put there and that tas care of twenty two and then we need twenty pole twenty granite street l i four four two zero going copy that description to work in this one has tree trimming in addition to police protection so i'm going to grab my tree trimming and police protection notes i also have coordinates for this one i'm going to grab those those in we can obviously make this box a lot smaller because we don't have the amount of work on this sheet let's see here i think that looks okay okay all right so twentyenty two all right so granite street is labeled and it's very visibly labeled so i'm not really going to worry so much about that i want to my box here is kind of locked off my ano associated with whatever street this is so i'm just going to add an electric construction note here that just says what street this is so what is it the walter hon parkway so walter and then not typing and then a w short enough fresh okay so what i'm going to do then is slide that over smidgemore and then i'm going to put the parkway on the bottom that way it'll show like that so granite street walker hand and parkway and then what am my cross my other street that i need so this is just a private drive it looks like a private driveway parker street is to the south and whitwell is to the north so so i'm just going to do whitwell street to the north whitwell yeah whitwell great there oh it's in the direction i'm going to add my directional pointing where it is and then if you go down i always said parker street was to the south so i'm just going to do you know down there install parker street ready next up in here so i got my streets i want to make sure that this number here is visible that's my pad associated with this primary riser that i'm splicing in cable for so i want to make sure that that address is labeled and listed all right let's see here i need tree trimming symbol or poull twenty pt to the northeast go and look at this see which it is this is just here and so it's probably for these trees in there is what i called it for so i'm to go back to the previous page where i have a tree trimming symbol i'm going to copy that go into here and just add one to the northeast here i will also like if say i have work that's just raising secondary here i would probably move the tree trimming symbol so it's more so on just secondary whereas i got a pole replacement i want them to look at it all i just kind of stick it all in the middle here that was the only tree trimming on this particular sheet okay on the other things looks like we need the feeder voltage which is just hiding there i can slide that over and then we also going to need some a primary wire ano for this pole here because we have pole replacement we're working in the primary zone so i want to have at least one of these primaries labeled to what it is so' going to go to trail have my primary selected and then i'm just going to draw a line along primary and do the create install existing phone okay and looks like my tree trimming symbol is blocking some of that so i'm going to just slide that anod down to the other side of the road awesome and then i think we're all set on this page too i'm going to turn off my worko flags my overlapping polygons my insertion points okay i'm just going to do it a quick look making sure you should be to seeing your work i'll also look at it again when i export it just to make sure that the pdf looks good comparatively all right so ready to save and then export this so i'm going to save it in the layout view and you got to remember that the layout view lives within the main small world window so in addition to saving the layout view you also want to save your small world window okay and then i'm going to come into the plotting tab again and i'm going to hit the print button the printer button this is what prints to prints out the pdf that we'll upload into storms this is the pdf that we'll actually put in our email to submit the application in national grid this is the pdf that we'll send and request the forestry review so i click the printer button now i have to hit the setup and this is going to export to my gis server i just made a video earlier today related tom sorry not the gis server this is the onedrive for gis docs and i made a video earlier about how the onedrive isn't syncing so hopefully this one's syncing so i'm just going to name it the gis design name which is just going to be our o seven test twenty five number so oh seven dash twenty five dash three one two one five six five three three one two one five six five three and i'm going to let that print let that little box disappear and then i'll actually open up the gis serverver oh my gosh i'm not the onedrive and there it is and i can just i've been noticing this it hasn't been exporting the entire set of construction sketches i just had this the other this morning as well i ended up having to go into here printth something to keep an eye out on but it's it only exported one of the pages before so let's see if that if that helped here here okay that's where the issue was is that i must have accidentally set only this page we want to make sure that the page range is all that's what that's the mistake i made there i'm going to overwrite it all right that's finished exporting and now we have our three pages or index page two page three of confirming here that i didn't leave my worko flags on or my overlapping polygons these are just the kind of things that you should be self qcing for that way you can go back in and re export with those turned off if you run into it so i'm happy with everything and then i'm going to click on the print pdf button this is what is going to the gis server and that is a condition for gis to design complete your gis design now to view the gis server there's a couple ways you go to file browse and that opens up this window and then you already have our design selected here you can go to the bottom here click construction plot pdf like i have to reselect it and then there it is and so whenever you make changes to your construction sketches you go in and realize that you forgot to turn off your workoint flags and you re export your sketches you always want to make sure you're re exporting both to the gis server and to the pdf that we're going to upload to storms and all of that fun stuff so you want to make sure that you every time you go in and make changes you want to go in and re export the sketches to both the gis server and then the local pdf and so i've done that the other way of opening and accessing the gis server is if you go into the this client on this client where we would normally access onedrive and gis there's this print pdf files hit launch i find this extremely helpful for overlapping projects especially as a if you are a designer like i feel like this is like huge because i can just take that gis design name browse and paste it in here with the asterk on either side i'm making sure that i select the right state and then i can do search and it shows me that there is a drawing there and when it was uploaded so i' also use that to confirm that maybe i made a change and then fifteen minutes later i made another change and i want to make sure that the gis server has the right set of sketches i can access it that way also when you get into doing overlapping work and you're in here clicking and getting gis designs from overlapping projects instead of going into storms and beingin like all right well this is the job where the construction sketches you can always go in and access it through this interface the only thing i would potentially be worried about is if maybe there was a change reflected in storms that wasn't reflected here but really the construction sketches in the gis server should be matching what is posted to storms and so that is going to be the long and short of me putting together the construction sketches for this application i'm going to save my work stop sharing and stop recording

VIDEO_ID: Work Order Training - Day 3 (Documents).mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] training we're going to be talking about documentation i'm going to be running through all the documentation that you will likely encounter when you're doing your work orders i've had josh send me his job his job is going to be the one that i'm going to be walking through since he has a pole replacement on it so i'm going to open that up i have his e five on the screen and i do remember this one as being an application where it was rear lot work so what i'm looking for here is the gis design so i'm going to come in here and do browse and i'm not the owner of this so i'm just going to clear out myself as the owner and i think we can do this to find just the work order number let's find out if that actually comes up with anything or if it just freezes i might have had to done it on one side and not the other is it like that can't remember in the meantime i'm just going to open up helix and i'm going to plug in that work order number because i want to find what the national grid district number is because that's going to be the code that's part of our gis design so zero nine is the national grid district here that's what i'm going to be searching for so insall of that zero nine dash here so it's going to be twenty five dash whatever that work order number is we'll be the gis design name i'll pull that up showing josh as the owner it's some proposed status i'm going to open this up it's going to ask me hey new conflicting data's been posted consider refreshing okay and whenever it says consider refreshing we want to refresh so you'll go to and that's not this refresh that i refer to in my writing a lot of time this is refresh the design go to file fresh design continue if there was some issue you would get some sort of conflicts failed conflicts not handled message when and if you did get one of those i would se send me a message and i can take care of that for you won't go too too much into that but all right so here's our gis design with our poll with work and let's just take a look at the construction sketches that josh put together for this we have one pole out in the middle of the woods that we're doing a pole replacement so there's really no i mean so there's you can kind of do the documentation in any order that you want i just kind of do things in my own way and so usually i do the dig safe first and the dig safe is going to be for you'll find with the documentation that a lot of the documentation that we end up having to do is driven by digging work you're replacing an existing pole that's digging work if you're installing a brand new pole digging work you're replacing anchors or installing anchors ground rod installations and replacements ground rods are often associated with transformer installations or push braces installation replacements those are all examples of digging work and so once you get one of those on your application you have to run through some of this additional documentation and the first one that i do is the dig safe and so in the work order resources folder go to work order resources was already there and there's a ds noe folder and there is an ne digsafe x i'm going to copy that i don't want to be updating the file that's on the sha drive because this is the one that everyone comes in to go and grab a copy of so i'm just going to go to a local folder call it fining and let's put in a new folder here josh that digafe in there and i'm going to crack that open so this is what the digsafe looks like everyone can see my screen correct i should have checked on that first awesome so this is the digsafe form you need to complete a digafe for basically the d digging work on each unique set of inter intersecting streets and for each pole not contiguous a maximum of three poles can be included on one single digafe form and so i just kind of threw together this quick little example here where we're just replacing these stars for poles so these three poles would be on one digsafe because we can have a maximum of three poles on a single form and these three poles all share the same intersecting streets they're all between marquette street and greenwood street so these three would be included on one digsafe this one is all by itself it has its own unique set of intersecting streets so it has greenwood street on one side and reagan on the other so this one would go on its own digsafe and then finally these two poles here would be on their own because they have regan and nicholas so we would have to cover these two three four five six poles we would need to create three different digsafe documents and the form that we're updating actually has three different sections we're skipping this middle section i don't know why they have the new york sex stuff in here new york has its own digsafe form that we fill out so in massachusetts we're going to be worried about this blue section up top and then the green section in at the bottom so first thing's first i need the work order number for our application that's going to be my dystipia work order number so paste that in here department performing work you're going to get that out of storms which is on the other screen so if we go into storms and so this here is the department performing work that email that just kind of went around just went around this morning about funding project numbers and barns and things like that this crew headquarters represents the national grid barn so this particular one the trucks are based out of this monson overhead barn i'm assuming in monson so this is going to be we're in massachusetts county it's usually right in storms as well county is hampton or if you weren't sure about what the county was you can also get that information right out of gis in your trail and you just drop a trail somewhere and do the where am i tool and that's going to tell you the county that you're in as well multiple ways i think helix probably tells you too so there's the county so camp den okay so it's lat long optional so this is how i fill out this if there's only one pole that i'm including on my digafe i'll put the coordinates in here so there's only one here i'm going to grab the coordinates from josh's construction sketches because those are the ones that i want to use those are the coordinates of the pole now if there were multiple poles featured on this digafe like our first example here with these three poles i would probably just put here multiple see below because my entries in here are going to include coordinates so but we only have one pole featured on this digsafe doc so i'm just going to add the coordinates here municipality it's going to be monson the street address well i'm just going to grab that from what was it in gis what was it showing here doesn't really look like we're showing an address that's off the screen so let's go into google maps hston and it looks like the address is drum roll thirty six fern hill road thirty six fern hill road cross streets okay basically this is the intersecting streets call them cross streets but so for ours situation here we're on kind of like a dead end here where it's basically this actually looks like just the end of someone's like the street just ends there so for one side i'm going to list the cross street as stateab let's see what street view shows for the signs so fern hill obviously there and bridge street stateab it looks like it just kind of it's either one of those is going to be fine here so i'm just going to do state a on the east and then on the west it's just going to be a dead end there's no street to the west so i'm just going to do dead let's see do fern hill road dead end and then i say state a statep okay method of pre mark okay and so a pre mark is something that will go out osmos for our jobs for the most part we'll go out in the field and we'll mark the pole that is being replaced we'll go out and usually with pole replacements we'll draw like an x a white x you might have even if you're doing design you might have seen poles with a white x on them or sometimes they use like a line with an arrow pointing down sometimes they use ds you're basically just identifying ahead of time which pole is being replaced related to the work that we're describing here so painted would be for a pole or push brace that's being replaced staked would be you know an anchor being replaced or maybe a new anchor being set and then you could also have a situation where you're replacing the pole and the anchor where you would select both of those in this case we're just replacing a pole so we're just going to do painted and we are going to actually request that pre mark to be performed in lci when we finalize our applications we'll come back to that but continuing on it says nrid use only here we're just going to click and this is always we're going always click simple and then if we click simple we're going to click this that's all we got to do there design investigator your name and your phone number this is something that will potentially generate phone calls i would say probably once every four probably three or four months i get a phone call from someone asking a question and usually i'll let it go to voicemail so i can like actually listen to it understand what they're saying and get the information you know so for instance the last one that i got you know he's like yeah i i just got the ticket for this job that you sent through on broadway and of course here i am going okay well i have no idea there's so many broadway streets in this state you know and i haven't done any jobs on broadway in a while so i had him send me the job and it was a job that i wrote the work order on three years ago so he just got the ticket now so there's some kind of time delay there but a lot of times i just get calls saying hey you know i just want to verify what pole you're replacing or what you're doing here obviously if you're not comfortable answering those calls i can certainly be the person that the point person for that or you can direct those calls or emails to me if need be but they do happen every once in a while so alicia hicks my phone number and then that's it for the top okay the bottom nature work description or work for a second absolutely sometimes whenever they call they don't have the total information yeah which is strange and sometimes they're talking about a p next to the pool that you didn't even design but they think you have the answer so just be careful when talking to them yeah it's because basically you're talking to the guy that's out in the field who's going to mark the you know mark the pole or you know spray paint the usually when they do the dig safe national grid will request twenty five feet around the pole for pre marking where you know you might have seen it when you are out and about and you see them you know maybe they're preparing for construction on your street and they spray paint you know where all the lines are and the pipes that's kind of what they're going to be doing for every one of these poles or any one of these dig safes that we're going out in the field to do potential work with they're going to be going out and doing a spray paint type thing so yeah they're absolutely right a lot of times they have very they have a very limited set of information or you know like the guy that's called me the last couple times he's calling from you know it's like ever source gas and i'm like well i'm not really doing work for ever source gas but he's the one that's actually out there doing the pre marking so for the off chance time that someone does call just usually the best way to go is just like let them like leave a message or you know take notes and you know say okay i'm going to get back to you and then we can figure out you know exactly what they what they're looking for how to answer their question a lot of times it's like hey you're trying to replace pole one but i'm out in the field and there's two poll ones which one is it and i'm like okay well along the way pull up street view oh it's the one with the transformer on it or something like that okay thank you you know so it's kind of a mixed bag with that and it's really happened i want to say twice in the last year for me so i don't want to freak anyone out with that yeah just wanted to bring that up because it can get confusing whenever they're not always very clear what they're looking for yeah yeah and then they might have terminology that you're not familiar with the guy was talking to me about like gas underground gas it's like oh you got some kind of duck here and i'm like i don't know what i just wrote the work order for the electric stuff i don't know anything about the gas you know but yeah and if there's any concerns or questions reach out to myself or your supervisor all right so nature description of work so this is what i will do here i usually like to because i know i'm going to do a notice of excavation potentially for this work and so i like to set things up in my dig safe so i can easily copy and paste over to my notice of excavation so usually what i'll do here is i'll just i you know noe information about the pole so it's pole ten burn burn burn hill road and then this is where i'll actually plug in the coordinates this is where i would plug in you know if i listed multiple here i will have the actual coordinates below and then i would just say replace pole that's all we're doing for digging work no need to add the transfers it's they're all worried about like what the digging work is that we're doing so now i'm just going to describe well where is the pole relation to identifiable location and so on and so forth so this one was kind of out in the woods here looks like it's on the south side of fernhill road and i'm just going to do an approximate measurement from the house to the pole site of three hundred feet so let's see pole is off the s side of the road approximately three hundred feet east of the house at and what is our address thirty six fern hill road that's it and then if you had another pole tab down here maybe pole twelve with different coordinates and then you would you know add the same kind of information maybe it's you know on the north side of the road and five hundred feet east so on and so forth there a very there is limited space within the section here unfortunately i know there's ways that to make the text smaller and stuff but you know we're not really writing a book trying to keep it you know as minimal because we we're going to have to do one of these for you know i mean potentially fifteen twenty of them for some of these larger jobs so you know they can be really time consuming so so the nearest house address i'm going to put thirty six maximum distance is usually going to be five hundred because we're listing the coordinates and you know we're not really like we're listing the coordinates of the dig location so i mean five hundred is most applicable all right now to the most probably the most confusing part of the digsafe is the municipal water and sewer notification section and that's really what i wanted to spend time with this morning when i was going in and doing my updating of the docs so for the section we actually use the it's a noe town by town water and sewer contact list from twenty twenty one that is in the work order resources folder under that state go back into the work order resources you go to dsn oe double quick to open this funny looking worksheet colorful and so here is the town by town listing where what they want us to do related to the notice of excavation at the bottom there's tabs so the state southwest i mean we used rhode island was on here rhode island's handled separately and then i really think we're doing it in new hampshire so just you're unable to find your town be aware that there's multiple tabs here so we're in monson which is in bay state west so i would come into this table and i would find monson okay and so monson has been identified is a dig safe member and so we to dig safe that it works so digafe is a notification center that dispatches utility companies to mark out locations of their underground facilities the free service notifies participating member utilities dig safe members are responsible for marking out their own markouts so when we come in here and it says dig safe member here we don't need to do a notice of excavation and so the section broken up by sewer in water water and sewer those are the town utilities that are referenced for this table okay where to go and so monson here's the water columns and it says water requires noe or call water contact name water phone number water fax and then here are the sewer sections sewer requires noe or call contact phone sewer fax etc so monson is a dig safe member the note here is just is not for us it's for know whoever is going to be actually preparing the dig safe tickets because what we're doing is we're creating a capture form we'll include this in storms and when it comes time to actually do the dig safes which is triggered by a requirement in storm usually a six forty five requirement so it's a bit further down into the requirements here just before it goes to construction they'll actually send in these digafe tickets using those capture forms that we're creating and request those tickets so that's what that is referring to here so monson is a digafe member for water and sewer so down here we would just say dig safe member and we don't need to do a notice of excavation now i've noted that here updating the water notification if town has water and is a digafe member we would check na looks like i forgot that part and then add digafe member to notes digsafe member to notes if town doesn't have water we would check na and then add no water to notes if town has water but isn't a dig safe member we would go in and check the applicable boxes so let's go back in and look at a different town out here so digafe member so williamsburg wants a fax for water and it looks like same thing for sewer it looks like it's the same contact information as well so williamsburg wants to be faxed the noe to this particular contact so if we were doing williamsburg down here i would check this fax form noe and then i would say fax to whatever the fax number is maybe the contact name or maybe the town water is wants a phone call check call and then just say call whoever at whatever phone number and same thing for the sewer and so i've added examples here to the table to kind of show what those results would look like there are going to be scenarios where the town does not have sewer but has water vice versus and so basically we're just showing on the digsafe how the municipality will be notified related to the work do they want a phone call or are they faxing over the ne to them in this case we were just doing digsafe member they were digsafe members so therefore we do not need to do an noe for this particular digafe if we did just a quick question who the hell was a fax machine very good question i haven't saw one of those like ten years i mean i i haven't seen one ages either but you know still you know like got that stuff to the government or you know a lot of the times places still want you to fax things to them and oftentimes i end up at like staples or the library to use a fax machine yeah the fax thing is silly but it's still there just i was kind of making a joke but at's the same time kind of serious and then also i mean also this list is a little on the i mean not that fax machines all of a sudden went out in twenty twenty one to twenty twenty five i mean fax machines have not been really around for a bit but yeah so sometimes you're going to run into scenarios where you it's kind of a mixed bag here obviously any questions related to this reach out and like i said i've updated this process doc to include a lot more of the detailed information related to filling out this section now' going to pretend that i needed to do a notice of excavation for this one so pretend that i said i'm going noe noe and we're going to fax the noe to to fax to megan g we're going to fax these to you megan with your fax machine all right i find an interace so the noe is actually located in that same location' just going to copy that locally and find my local folder i always do this meaning what do we say josh digafe i'm going to leave the digafe open because i'm going to copy stuff from the digsafe over into the noe ne has its own section here notice of excavations or the noe are required if the town has water and or sewer and isn't identified as it being a digafe member if the town requested a call a fax or an email as we've noted you know on the bottom of our digafe forms you will need to prepare an noe so you would do the dig safes before you do the nooes one noe is required for every digafe form prepared so if you had prepared you know to cover your job fifteen digsafe forms you would have to do fifteen nooes to go with it all right so this is what the form looks like let's walk through this one city town onon department this is just going to be either just sewer or you can just do sewer water or just water whatever the combo is for the contact information i only list the contact method preferred so if the town only wants a fax i would only list a fax number if they're only looking for phone calls i would only list a phone call same with the email so i'm just going we' going we're going to fax this to megan so i'm just going to say fax two and then one two three four five six seven eight nine nine is your phone number to megan and then we'll bump over here and we're going to go and fill out the work order number for the national grid work order number so that in this case it's going to be the three one two one three zero nine seven next up is the excavation for facility and here we're going to check all that apply so in this particular app we're just doing a pole replacement so that would be an existing pole we're replacing an existing pole new pole would be if we were setting a brand new pole which doesn't happen very often so in this case we're just doing a pole replacement if we were replacing an anchor we would check this if we were replacing a down ground rod we would check this if we were doing work for ug conduit cable usually associated with primary risers we would be checking that this case just the existing pole scope of national grid work this is where i like to copy and paste from digsafe so i'm just going to come back into the digafe and i'm just going to copy the scope of the work paste it in here address of excavation well got that address already here as well nearest intersection well i've already gone in and did the research on figuring out well where's the nearest intersection or cross street it was with state a so i'm just going to steal the intersection text from the form paste that here view of state have and bern hill road method of pre mark this is going to correspond with what we selected over here on the digafe remem painted would be for poles or push brace replacements stakes would be for anchor replacements or down ground rod replacement so method of pre mark this one is just a pole so i'm just going to do painted and then there's a spot for the sketch okay and so for the sketch i'm just going to grab those coordinates actually they're already here and i'm just going to zoom out to a point where i can see some streets and then i'm just going to center to that and using a snip tool i'm going to draw a box around my pole which opens up the snip i'm going to edit it and paint this is just how i choose to go in and get my do my sketches and then i'm going to add an arrow pointing up just to denote the north arrow and then i'm going to add just a poll number to the pin here so i'm just going to do e pole pen i'll shift that up and i'm just going to do a file save as now i like to do the sketches in this format because i'm actually going to use this sketch again because when we actually do the exchange of notice documentation which is an e n there's way too many very similar sounding acronyms the e n is for the replacement of join own assets like poles and anchors push braces and those will have a sketch section as well so i'm going to use this sketch again so that's why i like i do it in this form i do the extra work up front to get it in the right format that i want but then it saves me time when i have to go in and create that second sketch so back into my training folder and i'm just going to throw that in there close that for now close this dig safe so we'll get the noe over here and then i'm just going to go to insert expand here a little bit to find what is it illustrations pictures place over cll this device to go and find that image fining gosh grab it and then i can just resize as needed and there's your noe and so we had one digafe tenfern and because we did a digafe and we're pretending that they are not a digafe member we did an noe for that pole as well with the sketch there is our noe but i'm going to go back in and update this because this was a digsafe member so i'm just going to say da there and then i have my digafe off that rar roll and then i can just delete the noe because i don't need it so there's our digafe and our noe for this pole related to the digging work now one of the things you'll notice with a lot of these sections it talks about adding the requirements and all that fun stuff i like to do all of that stuff at the very very end when i upload all my documentation i'll go in and update all the requirements as well i like to do that so people aren't like accessing things so if i go in and add my construction sketches and then assign the two thirty six to forestry and then before i submit the job realize that oops i forgot a poll or something like that and then forestry already looked at it then i got to send another email out to say hey forestry you already looked at this i need you to look at it again because it wasn't ready generally i will just update all my requirements at the end so that way i'm not sending heads up to departments using the one's requirements saying that things are ready when they're not all right next up i would looked at the customer outage list this job actually doesn't have anything just just talk about what the customer outage list would be so so let me just show you what one looks like just had to do one with one of my jobs just the other dayah where did that p your money customerage list just a random one this one's actually got a few things on it nothing special they're just premise information service point information tied to the work so poll seventy four one we were doing a replacement of a service that was commercial and so i added this information so on and so forth and we would do that for any of the polls where we're doing work that may need the outage list well what types of situations where we need an outage list so whenever we're doing primary riser make ready that would be the replacement of the risers the cutout bodies fuse links or splicing in cable primary risers are kind of complicated make ready whenever we're doing that that type of make ready work we we're going to look for customers impacted from that work so that would be all customers commercial and residential whereas if we were only doing secondary or service replacements work requiring slicing and that would be for any ug wires primary or secondary work requiring splicing transformer related fuse link replacements or transformer replacements these would only be for commercial customers and then sometimes we run into situations where we're replacing a line cutout or on a tap and there's just a little note in here saying that we don't need outages an outage is going cost i believe a commercial outage is eighteen hundred dollars per a commercial outage is what the customer gets or the applicant gets charged so i think every one of these potentially represents eighteen hundred dollars added to the job related to doing the work this one we're doing splicing in cable on whatever this poll was and these were all the commercial clients that may need an outage so how do we determine like how do we determine if the customer is residential or commercial well one of the ways you can do it is and i've worked with a few of you on individual chats where we've actually gone in and looked at the service points and the premise data and all of that fun stuff so these yellow squares are the service points these represent the house or the business or industrial building it could actually even be a poll like if for instance the customer had their own poll with their own meter this yellow square could potentially be that their poll it's whatever is using that power whatever the load is on that electricity is the yellow and then it's usually either overhead fed or underground fed depending on the situation if it's underground fed there is likely going to be a riser all that fun stuff so when you click on the service point you can go into this premises attribute and that will give you just a little bit more information about the house at this location just basically the house number street to get the really good information the information that we're going to need there's one further layer we to go into this specials dropown esf data don't ask me whatf i want to say customer service thuming data and then that will give us all sorts of other information about our customer and what we're looking for is this resom field basically it's just indicating is this a residential customer or a commercial customer and then depending on the work we're doing we would either include it to the outage list or not so if i was replacing this service and the customer was a residential customer i would not need to do an outage because only commercial customers with secondary or service replacements would require an outage now if this was a c whatever reason maybe it was someone has like their business their haircutting place out of their house or whatever this was a c and we were replacing the service we would include that in the outage so how do we get things into an outage list we're actually going to use traces and then we use a trace very i want to say first day when we were trying to figure out where primary is coming from we did a source trace to go follow the primary feeder back up to the substation we're going to use traces to populate our customer outage list because the list what needs to include all this good information because they're going to take this information and actually turn it into some sort of they' probably condense the addresses and come up with a list of customers to actually send a letter out in the mail letting them know about the upcoming work and all of that fun stuff so to get that in there we' going to do a trace why that is there okay so to do the trace i'm going to drop my trail point i got my trail view here trail mode and i'm going to drop that trailo on the service and then i'm going to come up to an nrid electric and we're going to do directional trace directional trace which will open up another window and you want to hit downstream upstream would be to the you would basically trace it all the way out to the substation whereas downstream is just going to go from here to here downstream play of course small world needs to go in and analyze all those actual routes that are behind the scenes for our primary and secondary to figure out well what's upstream what's downstream before it can actually tell us the results for this downstream trace so it takes a second and then here's our result one customer and it has all the information that we need so usually i will select that record right click export to excel and since we're working in small world it's actually going to open up excel on the machine that gis and small world live on so this is not your local excel if you do a file save as you in national grid stff so usually what i will do is i'll have a separate excel file open locally i'll new and then i would just copy this usually like to grab the for my first one i'll grab the headers as well copy that and paste that into my local that down there and then above the line with the address information i'm just going to say six is what it is so poll six whatever street maple no burnill road replace service basically just what work we're doing that's resulting in the outage the fold here now sometimes you'll sometimes a lot of times we're going to be replacing fuse links associated with transformers so let's go in and look at a transformer does know what i'm talking about now you might have encountered it i feel like no if anyone has i think josh or john on your new jobs that you're working on you're going to have transformers but i don't remember if we've had anything come up in any of our other work that we've been doing i also possibly could be getting mixed up with something that i was doing myself but so going into preview just to kind of walk through this transformer here this is one of those this is one of those funny ugly looking ones maybe let's pick one that's not so rusty there's a bank i don't like these just want a basic transformer that does not need stuff done to it let's just go down on taas here there we go there's one but it's a taft in north main street of course i just zoomed off of where i was looking what was that here right there's taft so i suspect that poll six this is our transformer six i see it alight so the transformer will either have internal cutouts or fuses protecting it making the transformer a cstp or completely self protected is what that's short for those in gis will be a transformer without an s in the middle this particular one has a cutout associated with it on the like an external cutout so therefore it has the s on the outside i don't know why it's s but it is what it is and so when we replace trying to find a good it might even be better to show you in my oneene here let's see i do have an actual example of let's see cutouts in polymer so this is a cutout and you're actually looking at three different components when we're looking at these in jis for our work orders we have a bracket a fuse link and then the cutout body itself now when we're doing right a work order that has a transformer that's being transferred to the new pole we're going to replace the bracket in the fuse link tube itself i don't know if it's still in the office but there was a fuse link tube in the office when i was there last which is a while ago it actually shows you like you can pop that open and twist the top and actually see a little piece that's the actual fuse link that's in this tube so we replace the fuse link that lives in this tube in the bracket and then depending on the material of the cutout body itself we may transfer it if it's non porcelain or we might replace it if it's porcelain in appearance and just to kind of these are ones that look like porcelain that's a porcelain shiny gray's an ugly porcelain one oh here are the examples i looking for in the office so that is the fuse tube with the pin inside it so that's the link that's actually getting replaced the body is this whole piece and then this was attached to the cross arm or the pole with some sort of bracket so when we replace that fuse link we have to disconnect power and that's what drives the fuse link replacement on our customer outage list so if you're coming into this pole here and we're replacing the fuse link we're replacing the pole in the services and you're coming in here and replacing the fuse link we need to make sure that we're accounting for any commercial customers associated with that replacement so let's figure out what customers are actually associated with this transformer and this one actually happens to be a transformer bank as you have the circle and it's split into three different sections and so this is actually a two or three phase transformer bank and so to get the customers you can click on it go to specials customer details and that will open up another window which basically gives you a period of time and then it shows you the customers what their actual demand was on the system so on and so forth so we want to skip this ahead to something more recent and so these are going to be the customers associated with this transformer so if we are doing make ready work and the make ready work only let's just say we're raising this transformer we're not replacing services so we're raising this transformer and we're going to have to replace the cutout and when that we replace the cutouts we're going to replace the fuse links that potentially will drive an outage for these two customers because replacing this little piece here requires this to pop out basically disconnecting the the transformer from the primary cutting off that power and so therefore there might be an outage associated with that but those are our two customers now this isn't even real this isn't in the format that i really wanted so if i wanted to actually get this information in the format that i needed look at the address one six five nine nine that would be this here then i would just come back in here to a oh forgot to clear my trail from before right quick clear trail drop the trail back on that and then we're going back into our electric trace directional downstream it's still showing the results from the previous trace so we're going to hit the play again to have it run this next one and everything that we're doing is going to get double checked by someone with national grid so and also everything that your guys are doing at least initially will be checked by someone on osmo's team first too so there will be some qc involved with these wouldn't you're like looking at all this and going oh my god how am i going to remember all of this okay so we got two customers that are commercial and then i'm just going to select them right click export to excel they opened up another excel sheet then i can go into the outage list that i had been starting and paste those over so let's see add some more space here we do this pole five street i'm just going to make up the street doesn't matter five main street didn't even spell it right mina street that works replace uselink and then i would grab out of here and so i usually do this part after you obviously i've done all my sketches and i'll usually go just page by page in my construction sketches just to make sure that i've caught everything and then just kind of look at what i'm doing for work okay i'm replacing a service here replacing a riser there you know and then i'll go in and actually do the traces and figure things out i probably you know before i go in and run traces just i would probably check some of these on an individual basis to see if they're residential or commercial before going in and doing the downstream trace just to find out that it's not and then we would just we would keep adding to this now i had mentioned the primary riser let's find one of these so this is a primary riser so we get double phase primary hey let's actually look at it instead of me just visually doing it because i love google maps and there we go looks like we're going to rocky's hardware all right so this is a primary riser my riser being that primary is going underground here or potentially depending on where we're located primary could be actually coming out and out from underground here so sometimes you'll have these poles just outside of a substation and oftentimes it's the first pole out of the substation where that feeder is going over ahead in this case this is going to a customer and this it looks like one five eight one which is rocky's ace hardware so they wanted primary voltage instead of their secondary servace and so the riser the riser usually has a steel pipe at the bottom u guard all the way up got a termination bracket on the flip side it looks like it looks like the top that looks like top primary is going underground so the top primary comes here hits the double cross arm we have three cutouts we have arresters better angle over here that's a cutout this is a cutout this is another cutout and they're all on their own brackets this is an arrestor that's an arrester and there's another arrester hiding behind this these white wobs here those are animal guards on top of the terminators this is called a termination bracket and then you have your wires going underground so we were replacing this pole we would probably be replacing this primary riser as well and that would require them to basically c that p cut that line potentially to add in more wire you know if we have to splice in additional cable oftentimes there's not enough material in the existing wire to raise primary up the distance that we need it to so oftentimes replacing a primary riser also involves splicing in cable and so this primary riser would replacement would impact both commercial and residential customers and those appear in gis as so we got the through primary one primary that looks like it's dead ending and then the checked line implies that it's going underground the dark line implies that it's in conduit and it looks like those are the cutouts associated with that as well and then the last thing that i noted here was there one thing we have to do with majority of these obviously kind of pad mount before that is there anything we have to do with the pad mount not usually no okay so the pad mount so what's going to end up being is like if we're replacing this pole we'll do a downstream trace and so this ends up being the customer associated the customer that's going to be impacted by the work so we're not usually working on the pad mount okay just curious because i didn't know if we had to go the whole way to the customer or if we just stopped at the pad m well in regard to what the trace or the actual work the actual work so i mean so it depends if it's i mean it depends on what the engineer wants oftentimes they might come in and say hey just replace this entire conduit from the pole to the pad other times we'll be okay with just being able to basically split out a section of the primary replace that section just to get the material that we need primarizers can be kind of complicated and oftentimes we'll need to check with national grid on how they want to handle them and then the last thing here it says line cutouts and fuse link replacements associated with the line cutout so we went over that transformer transformers have their own protecting cutouts and they have the fuse links associated with them these look like porcelain cutouts i happen to pick porcelain that would be replaced you can even see right here at the top here there's a stencil it says twenty five k but that was still correct these would be twenty five k fuse links three twenty five ks protecting this bank so we know we talked about the fuse links associated with transformers and if we're replacing fuse links and the customer commercial we would include those on the outage list now there are going to be scenarios where we are doing work on a pole that has a line cut out try to find one that there's some so if we were doing work on this pole that angle that angle again we're replacing this pole and we had to replace this line cutout they're not really protecting a specific piece of equipment that cutouts would be on a transformer primary riser they're just in the line to offer additional protection and so if we did a downstream trace on a line cutout like now this guy electric trace directional and then we do a downstream trace on this one there's going to be tens if not hundreds of customers and to avoid all of those outages because as i had mentioned you a commercial outage is like eighteen hundred dollars we just came back with potentially thirty customers that are downstream of that line cutout i do is zoom two so if we were to do an outage list tied to this work we would have to include all of those customers because all of that would be offline related to that replacing of the fuselink so what they'll have to often do is they will just install a jumper so the power continues and then they'll replace so they'll me go back into street view here so what they'll do is they'll basically jumper primary over to let it continue while they replace the cutouts or do with the work that they need to do and then they have to reconnect everything so that way there's no outage required for the line cut out fuselink replacements so that was the customer outage list is there any questions on that or maybe how to find the customer information you know i'm not sure what we've been run into with the jobs that we have i mean i think a few of us have only had like one po replace one pole apps or one or two pole apps so i don't think we've run into a lot of this kind of stuff yet that's the customer outage list and the next one we're going to go over is the environmental checklist which find it view navigation pane environmental checklist so got to get back to i' going clear out of that i got to get back to your poll with work here and i'm going to turn off some of these overlapping polygons just because they're kind of in the way here all right so the environmental checklist is located again on the work order resources folder under the environmental section and then you go there's checklist for the other states in here as well so just make sure you're grabbing the one that's massachusetts these will be periodically updated this is the latest and greatest i'm going to paste that my local folder usually for the name on this i usually will just change this to e and b i checklist and then the work order number three one two one three zero nine seven and i'll probably grab that put that in my cope buffer because i'm going to need it again i'm going to open up the checklist to one page all right so this is what the checklist looks like basically reviewing the digging work this is another documentation another set of documents that dve is driven by digging work so we have questions that potentially answer and then space at the end to fill out so up top i'm just going to do the work order number project name is just going to be the application name and we don't need to fill up the associated work order work order numbers one location it's just in monson first complete a list is just going to be whoever's filling it out want to list today's date and then estimated start date in new england is six months out from when we're filling out the checklist so december january february march april may so five fourteen twenty six i tell you and filling out the environmental checklists makes the years go by quick because i'm already thinking five it's already may twenty twenty six scope of project okay why are we filling out the environmental checklist well what does our digging work in this case it's just one pole replacement one pole all right so now we're going to use process doc to help fill out the checklist here so for question one we're going to use this mass mapper interactive map from massgis the link is here so i'm going to paste copy that and two and you may have seen me reference this yesterday on one of the training sessions or on a call yesterday i can't remember if i was on with everyone or just i think it was ivan's job actually that i think no no it was josh's job that we were looking at that that's right so you can come in here and you can type in the town monson or you could type in the address what was it what did i say this was was it fern hill road monson all right and then so usually i like to have google maps open as well that ain't it this over here though i'm just going to grab the coordinates right out of my e five so probably easier to look at it this way so question one on the checklist are any bodies of water or indications of wetlands or flood plains within a hundred feet of the proposed work or is a river or stream located within two hundred feet how do we figure that out well process doc it says go into the physical resources so we go to physical resources hydrography water features and then we want to go into this dep wetlands layer and then we just got to toggle on all of the layers within it just clicking on it and moving on to the next one okay and then we want to go into this regulated area section and we're looking for fema flood data and then i usually will do polygons okay and so now i look at where my pole is or my work is in relation to the assets shown i mean in relation to the polygons and polylines shown in the mass mapper now i like to see everything in the aerial imagery so i'll turn the aerial imagery on and i'll kind of just eyeball where the pole is so the pole is probably somewhere in here and then i'm going to measure to the north well two hundred feet is our max there's no hits within two hundred feet to the north or the west or the south so it does look like there's stuff around but it's not within the buffers that we're looking for i think the wetlands was a hundred feet and the rivers and streams was two hundred feet so there were no hits on that so we come into the checklist we're going to mark question one as no which means that we can skip the next five questions two five and that's all questions one a through e are only required if you check yes for question one now the trail i'm going to pretend that my pole was over here somewhere so you know i got to hit on this stream over here and so in here i would change this to yes and then i would come in to the comment section and do q one and i would just say yes and then note well why did i check yes on this pole four is within two hundred feet of river stream and within flood zone or whatever the node is and we're only looking at you know one poll here now sometimes i have jobs where i have a lot of polls that i need to review the environmental checklist for and so what i've done is i usually create in my local directory let's find one of mys here so this particular application had an idea fourteen dig saved and so i needed to fill out the environmental checklist for this and so what i usually do is i take our designed csv i add a column called digs and then i just go through and note whether in this case it looks like i added a one all the polls that had some sort of digging mark and so now i have a csv that has all of those pos shown and then i can go into my google maps because i'm a google map fan i can go into saved mapped create map new map import that csv data so that lowell that i go to think i went to the cns lowell digs that's fine okay where are we putting the basically the coordinates what field are we using for coordinates usually pre selected so that's good here we're just going to click on structure number that's the poll number finish now this shows me all of the poes in the town did the digging work and then i can use you maybe i want to make these uniform style all the same color you know let's make it stand out compared to the rest of the stuff that's in town and then i can take this and compare that with what i have in the mass mapper so that way i can say i'm not even in there's lowell up here somewhere right here somewhere i might even be i know that's lowell got lowal you so i can probably come in here and just say okay i have all my layers all right this poll is within a hundred feet ye move on to the next one up this pole is and so i can very easily from the one view here review question one for all of my poes and then as i make findings i can add those to the list you know yes pole four is within two hundred feet poll sixty three is within a hundred feet of river whatever it is and so this is how i like to go in and review my environmental checklist if i have lots of poles to check because it can be really tedious to go in there and go okay let me type back in my coordinates into google maps pull it up look at it over here move on to the next one or just find that this is the easiest way of doing it for me so in this particular application we did not have to check anything because remember there was no hints there was no go back to there it was get back to where it was what was that fern hill road in monson so there was no hits this stream was well outside the two hundred feet the floodplain stuff flood zone stuff was well outside of two hundred feet so we marked the first question on our checklist as a no and therefore we can skip these next questions and go on to the next one so this one is usually can be skipped if the pole is see so the next question two can be skipped if work is on or within ten feet of a paved roadway well our poll is kind of out in the middle of the woods get back to where i was our poll is out here somewhere it's probably you a hundred feet off of and i don't even know if that's a paved road or it doesn't even look potentially paved over there so we're going to have to answer this question well how do we answer that question back to mass mapper i can find it many windows open back to mass mapper then go to the conservation and recreation you can leave all those other layers on does not matter go to the conservation recreation section and we're going to go to natural heritage data i always do that natural heritage data and then you're going to select cl the right click add is no longer it's just a click there rare species there it is and then what this does is this adds these yellow polygons that you see out here to the view and you would mark that question yes if our pole fell within one of those polygons but no i don't sadly i lost track of where i was gosh bern hill roadonson in fact monson is next to grant barringtononson there it is okay so so no hit there mirrors one is way out there back into the checklist no according to the customer property owner our national grid gis is the proposed work area within or adjacent to a contaminated area so how do we know well in gis small world go into the object control you'll see that this layer is already there and it's defaulted to always be on so if you've exported sketches or you're currently in this view and you didn't see some orange let's find an actual polygon that represents one of these guys so if your poll was in or adjacent to across the street from in an area of one of these polygons we would potentially have to mark you know yes rarely do we get hits with that in this case we got nothing so that's a big fat no any nationally registered historic sites districts blah blah blah but basically we're just looking for you historical houses archaeological stuff historical zones things like that the website that's actually in the link here is really helpful and then i'm just going to click okay same deal little map view i'm to go into monson search monson massachusetts and then figure out where my poll was in relation to have this thing where i have to like try to find it without actually cheing but let's just do the fern mill road onon okay and so what we're looking for here is is our pole in one of these polygons or is our pole in front of one of these points the polygons usually represent historical districts so this is the right wire mill district and so if we had a pole replacement that fell in that polygon we would mark this question as a yes and we come over here to the notes and say see to what was that question for yes pole for is in the right wire historical district or maybe your pole is across the street from this or next to or in front of this pin here this little dot which is usually historical home so i would say you pole is near the historical home the frank shaw house located at ten o nine five thorndike street or whatever and then i would just go in and just list any of the other applicable historical sites i wouldn't go crazy but we definitely want to make an effort to list this you what we encounter what we see there so again your job josh to do your job didn't have any hits yeah this was down there but our pole is up here somewhere so not really anywhere near will any structural materials potentially be containing asbestos lead paint or pcbs be disturbed removed or encapsulated so sometimes you're going run into with risers they might be asbestos might look asbestos i can try to find an asbestos example and share those in the chat when i can find them but oftentimes if there's the potential for asbestos on our riser wires or maybe we're replacing a transformer that might have pcbs those are generally going to be the scenarios where we're going to be checking that checkbox and it's usually just asbestos or a transformer that's being replaced where we would note that oftentimes we'll note in the e five that it's an asbestos riser potentially asbestos riser there are things that you know we'll need to do or national grid will need to do related to that so if we identify potential asbestos riser on the environmental checklist send it for review the environmental team will actually go out and send their contractor out in the field to test the riser to determine if it's asbestos or not and then if it comes back as asbestos we might just have to replace the whole thing rather than maybe just splicing in cable or whatever other work that we're doing with it so this is usually for asbestos in risers or pcbs associated with transformer replacements okay next question question six got an eye on the time here we only have three more questions here all right so question six according to the customer property or municipality or national grid will the proposed instulation of treated wood poles take place within fifty feet of a known shallow drinking water well okay so this only applies if you're replacing a pole so if you're digging work that's resulting in you filling out the environmental checklist is an anchor you don't have to worry about this question this only pertains to pole replacements because the new poles that are being put in the ground are treated with chemicals and pending on whether or not it's near groundwater or not could potentially leach into the ground i suspect they will choose specific pos types like i know in new york we would actually request a ninety day dried pole related to the chemicals just to prevent leaching into groundwater not sure if that's what happens here or not but to check if you're near any shallow wells we got to go drive out to the poll and grab your measuring tape wait no it's also right in gis so we got to actually go in and add public data now there is a section in the process doc that kind of talks about accessing gis public data if i breeze through this too quickly but so what we got to do is we got to add the shallow well database here it's not one of those defaults that pop up in this list so to add it we go to n grid this is this order of clicking oh just drives me a little crazy we go to gis public data and that opens up this little window and we got to go file open and that opens up the gis public data it should just go right to the location there's an environmental shallow wells folder so we can select the file the cfg file that's within click open but that doesn't actually open it you got to click on it again then go to data set open and then it will work its magic behind the scenes i usually wait for it to stop looing or whatever nothing really popped up and to verify that it's on it will show up over here on the left with all three dots there and we didn't have any hits they're usually polygons that are about this size and they're green no there's one so that's whats a shallow well is and the rings around it are just buffers around the center point and i can't remember if it's twenty five feet and then fifty feet but we had no hits on ours so that's going to be a that was a no for the asbestos i forgot to click that and then question six is also a no questions seven and eight check no and check no no no and then we can skip those questions and then i would save the checklist so we had one pole replacement i'm just trying to save this for you josh so one pole replacement no bodies of water no no no no no it doesn't look like we had any hits so because we didn't have any sort of you know didn our poll didn't match any or we didn't mark yes to any of the questions as related to the poll with digging work what i'm going to do is i'm just going to come into the end here and just say no environmental concerns and i'm just going to save this so this we've done the environmental checklist for this job because we did not mark yes to any of these questions we didn't have any results here we're not going to need to request an environmental review for this work now if we did in fact have yeses to this or any of these other questions we had some results here we would need to send an email to the environmental folks requesting an environmental review but here we do not need to do anything with that so i purposely stopp this or set this meeting to end at fifteen before eleven so we can i'll grab a quick break before we have to go on to the new england call any questions any before i turn off the recording and we go to break obviously there was a lot of information here i do want to pick up kind of where we left off when we come back we were the last piece or the second or last piece was going to be the e n exchange of notice which is tied to joint owned replacements for poles anchors push braces so if you have a pole replacement on your app you are going to need to probably do one of those so i would like to revisit that after our new england call so open up the floor for questions otherwise we'll take a break and i'll see you guys all on the new england call com on yeah appreciate you yeah i'm going have questions for now as well yeah i will all right i will stop the recording alright

VIDEO_ID: The_first_5_moves_every_bjj_white_belt_should_learn.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] hello again my favorite group of mat savages with gyms opening up again and people getting back to their favorite choking pastime well maybe their second favorite one something i've been noticing is that there are a lot of beginners on the mat and this could be people that did it for a couple months before the break and are back now or people that are just starting out and it's their first week whatever the case i thought it was appropriate to make a video that would be helpful for all those beginners that i would have found helpful back when i first started so today we're going to be covering the first five moves that every white belt should learn alight guys first of all if you're new to the channel i'm jedi in the six plus years that i've been doing jiujitsu i've competed in over fifty tournaments and i draw from that experience to make videos like this one every friday where i give you guys practical tips that are going to help you deal with the problems you face on the mats so be sure to give this video a thumbs up obviously if you guys plan on getting good at jiujitsu you want to do it for a minute which ideally that's the plan hopefully you guys are going to be doing ju jitsu until your body falls apart i know that's my plan right now i guess we'll just have to wait to see how that goes you obviously will need more than five moves however the moves that we're going go over today are going to give you guys the biggest pain for your buck especially if you're a beginner these moves aren't gonna take a ridiculous amount of experience and practice before you can start hitting them on the mats and then adjusting fine tuning so that they match your own personal style and they're also very effective you're going be able to hit them from the places that beginners usually tend to find themselves from close guard side control mount we're going start off with two submissions because it's really awesome when you hit your first submission really motivates you to keep coming back one guard break because a lot of beginners tend to find themselves in closed guard a lot and they don't really know what to do once they get there and of course we're going to go over two escapes because as a beginner i know this is true whenever i first started you're going get your guard past a crap load and so it's important to have a couple go to escapes whenever that happens to help get yourself out of those situations so that jiuj jitsu is a little more enjoyable for you to keep coming back and keep getting better at first technique we're going to go into with the arm bar is a very versatile submission grab your partner's neck to break down their posture then you're going step on their hip on the same side and push your knee up against their shoulder to keep them from pulling their arm out next push off on their hips to bring your body perpendicular to theirs clamp down on their shoulders to keep them from slipping out you almost want to think about kicking them on the back of the neck in one motion bring your other leg over their head and curl it down to keep everything in tight to finish just grab their wrist and bridge your hips or you could pummel your under hook under their top arm and extend your hips for an inverted arm bar finish if they pull their arm out as you step over you can also transition to the triangle another thing the arm bar has going for it is the fact that it's so versatile you can also hit it from the mount from side control and from back control our next move the triangle is a great submission for both beginner and advanced grapplers from the overhook switch your hips out to the side step on your ap partner's hip then grab your partner's wrist shove it to their chest and throw your leg over the back of their neck bring your shoulders out so you have enough room to triangle your legs and sometimes it helps if you grab your own shin and if you don't have the overhook just cup their head step on their hip and do everything the exact same way as before and if you get to the triangle but you can't finish with the choke you can always finish with the triangle arm bar or you can throw your leg over their head to make it a lot tighter the triangle is another versatile submission you can also hit it from side control as well as from the mount our third move is going be a standing guard break because in my experience those are the most effective ones before going for this it's important to address any grips that your partner tries to throw up grab your partner's gy right in his armpits straighten your arms and then lean forward so you can walk up and place your knees directly under their hips sit back like you're sitting in a chair and arch your back so that you can keep good balance if your partner tries to break down your posture again be sure to put their shoulders back on the mat before you finish this guard break place your open hand directly under their kneecap and push down to open their guard you can also post in your partner's biceps before you straight arm to stand up and another way to finish the guard break is to just scoop under their top leg and shuck it across i actually learned this guard break at my first seminar from ufc welterweight james kraus and our next move is going to be an escape from the mount kneet your partner in the butt to make them touch the mat this will make their hips lighter then turn to your side and frame on your partner's hip with both your hands while keeping your elbows close to your body bring your bottom knee under your partner's shin exposing their foot and then step over with your top leg to lock it up then block their knee with your forearm so that you can bring your bottom leg up and around putting them into half guard another option if you can't bring your knee under their shin is to just grab their foot and place it in your guard and if they have their ankles under your hips you can use your top foot as a butterfly hook to put them back in your guard our last move today will be an escape from side control bring your hands to frame in your partner's armpit and inside their elbow bring your hips out at an angle and bridge hard then block their leg with your bottom knee and extend it to give yourself enough room to retain butterfly guard and once you bump you can also go straight to close guard an important detail on this move that a lot of people mess up is once you bring your knee in you have to fully extend your body otherwise you won't have enough space to retain guard and when you bump if they try to pressure back into you you can stiffarm their elbow and roll them across your body alight guys those are our five moves for today now i'm out here i just set up a brand new complete today super nice board really really good pop to it so i'm gonna hit a quick little session and afterwards we're gonna wrap up the video with some final thoughts alight guys that was actually a pretty good skate sess that we just hit now those shove it were a little sketch on the landings but it still work in progress i promise the next time you see me they're gonna be a lot smoother like i said guys the five moves we went over today were moves that i was using a lot in the first year two years that i started training you're gonna find yourself in position to hit these moves a lot especially the escapes that we went over you're probably gonna find yourself in closed guard a lot so it's good to have a nice weight to get out of it and then also it's nice to hit a submission every now and then that's not too hard for someone to learn in a couple weeks and start hitting on other people at about the same skill level and if you guys are still watching the video i appreciate you thank you for coming and hanging out today be sure to subscribe to the channel enter on the notification bell i post a new video just like this one every friday giving you guys the tips that you need to deal with the problems you face on the mat you guys have been awesome i've been jedi talk to you next week stay consistent the bag i'm so they it h like tenes no but just me

VIDEO_ID: WorkingThroughGIS_Design Part 1.mp4
TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0-999.0] all right so we are just going to run through doing cost units for an application that i just did all the gis edits for there's a mix of power nrity and pole replacements nothing too fancy but i figured it would be a good opportunity for folks to see cost units in action especially with pole replacements and such so the job that i'm doing is in lenox so i have the work order number and i've already gone into storms and i i'm grabbing the national grid district so that's zero nine so i'm just going to go to file browse clear out my name and i'm going to go zero nine dash two five whatever that work order number is look for it found something in dm admin is the owner so i'm going to right click on that and i'm going to take ownership and i click in the white space here to get that to actually show that i'm the owner then i'll double click on it now this application was surveyed in look via lci i am just going to for the sake of this presentation look at polls in streak view streetview is a little outdated in some of these polls but you know look only really shows one or two poll photos it's to get hard to look at the spans and look or even in survey photos so i'm just going to use google maps for this exercise i've already gone through and reviewed all the look photos my gis edits all right now we' still we're in this read only state and i'm going to go to file change state proposed so the first poll would work is this secondary reduced drip loops so let's go in and actually look at the poll so i can show you what it is that doing right and i just i love just google maps or the web browser just that's more of my jam and i've seen folks using google earth whatever floats your boat point twenty three on this imagery it looks like and what we're doing is we're reducing the drip loops and so it's likely what we're doing here is we're probably cutting out some of the slack here associated with those transformer drip loops so that way they can get another applicant on the pole up here that's likely all we're doing here now when i go through and do my g edit i also look at pole access and i also look at tree trimming because i want to do all of those things at once so the work here is just focused in this section so if we had a tree in up over here we have a tree over in this span we don't need to call for tree trimming because the work that we're doing does not actually involve that wire that's running through the trees we're only doing our work here now if we were raising secondary up and that was going through trees then i would call for tree trimming but we're just doing this drip loop work on the pole so this is roadside and there's no tree trimming so i've noted that or at least i've noted the tree trimming i just assume that it's police protection and if it's anything else whether it's off road work or rear lock work i will just note those in the descriptions of work so reducing the drip loop here and it looks like it's the transformer drip loop i'm just going to grab my gis id go into the navigator that in go some i did a file alternative and looks like i did some gis edits here and so i can actually go into the anchor is where i made my edit go into the object relationships and just see that i changed the lead length from zero to ten that job this is a way to check your file alternative and your gis edits have been accounted for now it's kind of i mean some of these polls and objects will have a lot of things going on and how things list in here it's kind of confusing but usually i look over and see what my username is and what i did if you were ever questioning shoot did i make that gis edit already there it is okay so what we need to do is we are going to add the cost units now the first thing we're going to do is looking at the description of work is there anything that needs to be any real world objects in gis that need to be replaced removed installed and the answer is no you we're not replacing a poll we're not replacing a riser anchor down guide those are all things that we would need to replace first those are the real world objects and then we would put a point span editor and generate work records that would auto generate the work records and then we could go in and modify update remove cost units as needed this particular work is just reducing drip loops this is not a real world object so we're going to have to go in and manually create our worko flag to do that we're going to select the poll and under pointspan editor there's the create from selection button and that will create that work point flag and it looks like i got to toggle that on here we go and so now i still have that poll selected right and so now in the editor i mean back in the point span editor i'm sorry we're going to click one selected and then i'm going to click the edit button and that tas me just to the work point so that tells me that i click the wrong one i need to click the associate map selection via editor there's the poll and now we should be able to add that cost unit so add co now my favorite list is got a ton of cost units in it i'm not really going to cheat and grab the drip loop cost unit for my favorites we're actually going to go and find it and so i'm going to go into the i need to open up work order resources where's this what did i put those under is that under process documents i think h i'm going to open up my cu list that everyone should have access to and just as a reminder this list has the columns has the cu name in this column the description which group in c the co selector the object is located what operations are associated with the cost unit so install remove or t is transfer and then just some notes about the cost unit so drip loops are second secondary related so we're going to go down to reduce secondary drip loops okay so there's two cost units there's an sla and a tla it's either a service labor adder or transformer labor adder these are the similar to the labor adders that we're doing for rear lot work or same hole set they have no materials associated with them they're just adding additional labor to the job so this is actually a drip loop associated with a transformer so i'm going to grab the tla cost unit go into gis and i have the code so leaving the group checked i don't care that it's looking at the poll and just paste in the code obviously not going to find anything because the cu list is telling me that it's in the labor adder's overhead folder but that's okay i don't really have to go look at the folder i'm just going to uncheck groups and it will find that cost unit for me so if you right click go to cu or ma reports record has no corresponding material so i'm just showing you that this is just a labor adder it's just adding a quarter hour of labor to this pole in order to basically reduce those drip loops tie them up tape them up whatever they're going to do so i'm going to close that and then i'm just going to hit okay here because i sometimes will have you click apply in here or okay okay we'll close the window so i would do okay if you're done adding cost units whereas i hit apply if i want to if i know what additional cost units i want to add so i don't have to basically reopen this window so i'm done with adding cost units for this pole so i'm going to hit okay and so now i have that one cost unit here related to that transformer drip loop and now i'm going to hit save let's move on to the next one next one was a secondary raise a significant secondary raise so let's go and take a look at that one that's right okay so again i'm just going to go to google maps i grab the coordinates out of the e five usually and then paste them in here okay so this is our pole and we're doing a secondary raise and so according to the description of work we are raising secondary on a tenash one hundred fig two bracket which according to the cost unit list is this cu i got to change change this now's it's sort of ten there we go i know that that was in there and that's been in there for a bit okay so we're going to be replacing the bracket raising okay installing a new bracket thirty eight inches up transferring that wire up to the new bracket and then removing the old note that there is a midpan tap coming off of the line midpan would be anything coming off of the conductor in the line regardless of whether it's in the middle or in this case just a couple feet from the pole and this is appears to be going to a pole here and if we go back into gis that's what we're seeing here there's the secondary crossing the road to a pole now one of the things that we need to consider that's not always considered in design is that when we raise secondary thirty eight inches what sort of impact is that going to have on this wire you know are we going to raise this so much in a way that it's going to cause issues with this wire here i said no i didn't think that there was going to be an issue we're going up that we're going up thirty eight inches so what three feet i mean we're going way up but i still think there's plenty of slack in the line to accomplish that raise now if i was concerned one thing i would add to the description of work as a work order writer would be okay raise secondary thirty eight inches toa and then i'm going to go into my work description style sheet which this i believe this was in the wherever this was located i'll save as work order resources process documents and so i'm going to come in here and i'm going to modify this description of work for new england so on a side note in new england with services when we're either doing a pole replacement or service is raising ten inches or more we're going to replace the service now services in gis are considered from pole or mid span to a basically the load who is pulling on that power and might be the house or it could be a barn basically running from the pole or from the wire to the meter on the house is considered a service whereas secondary running between two poles is just considered secondary so this is not considered a service this is just raising secondary that happens to be running from this pole to that pole happens to be tapping off of the mid span here all right so if i was concerned about the amount of material here i could go into my work description style sheet and copy this add splices to extend service as necessary five dash one four four now this isn't a service but we're going modify that description work a bit to make it fit what we're doing here so i'm going to copy that and i'm just going to paste that in here under the secondary here and then i'll say add splices to extend secondary tap to and then what pole was that that one it's this one pole thirty seven dash one thirty seven dash one as necessary and adding splices is three cost units splicing in cable is basically just adding more material to extend make a conductor longer they have to cut it they have to add the material in and then they have to go in wire by wire and connect them together so some labor some labor associated with that now when we're splicing in cable we're doing it on a leg basis so i had a i don't have a couldn't tell you where that screenshot is but triplex is essentially three wires all wrapped together into a single multiplex conductor so it's two hot legs and one neutral the hot legs being that's where the electricity is running and the neutral is just the system neutral that's within that multiplex okay and so when we call for splicing we need to splice those wires individually so whenever we call to splice in cable for triplex we're going to be addingice a splice for the hot legs and a splice for the neutral legs now i just determined that i didn't think that there was additional material needed here so i'm going to clear that out another job down the line i did add additional material so we will come back to this i will note here no additional material needed just to note for myself here all right so we're raising secondary a bunch inches thirty eight inches let's go in and add this no real world objects that need to be replaced installed or removed tied to this if there was a service associated with it we would replace the service because that's a real world object but nothing there so like the first pole i go in pine pole thirty seven it's selected i go to point span editor i drop in my worko flag click on to associate via map selection now we're in the pole usually i will use the pole object as my container to hold a lot of the cost units there are going to be cost units that are going to want to be in certain folders especially if they're tied to realar world objects so if you replace we'll say a existing down guy it's going to generate three folders one is an anchor and guy tied to the actual anchor and then it's going to have a folder tied to the removal of the down guy and then install the down guy so if you maybe delete one of those and then just add the install to your pole folder small world is going to freak out because it can't find a cost unit associated with installing or removing that down guy this case raising secondary we're just going to go in and add the transfer of the wire and the installation and removal of the brackets so back to my excel sheet and so for the secondary bracket we're using the pr one sts the add that's in my favorites but uncheck group gives us all the options going to be the first one so i'm not done adding cost units in here so instead of hitting ok i'm going to hit apply and so we're going to install and remove this one install remove and then for the secondary we're just going to use a generic triplex secondary transfer so i'm going to go back into my excel sheet with the cu list so we got service conductors secondary brackets neutral conductors secondary conductors and so there's just a few of them in here like this is not an exhaustive list there's lots and lots of examples we' trying to make it as you straightforward as it can be and so i'm just going to grab this one which is just a generic one ought triplex i'm going to copy that paste that into my code select apply going be transferring this all right and that's it that one now i think i did look what did i say on tree trimming i said no tree trimming here so we raise secondary down to this next pole the line looks pretty clear the trees that we're seeing are in the background sometimes you have to i love looking in street two you have to like zoom up a little bit further in the line and then look back to see the right angle yeah no tree trimming in that span and then the span coming back to here that secondary is this wire and it looks like we are kind of close there but if you actually look at where that tree is in the property it's way back there and then there's a great little street here that we can just jump over to and see that that tree is well off of secondary the clearance is between secondary and trees i think is eighteen inches so that's well out of that area and then the last one that i wanted to check was so when we are raising this it's going to obviously raise this wire too so we needed to be aware of any tree trimming needs on that span and that's well high enough that we don't need to worry about it there so i didn't know any tree trimming on this pretty flowers all right moving on to the next one next one's a pole replacement okay and pole also has a riser down guy we get a ug service with my poles with digging work or poles with tree trimming or i will put coordinates in in the format that i want them in here as just my own personal preference that way because again i use coordinates all the time let's copy those out alighty another one of these poles out in the middle of the field okay this was the pole that i did the screen share or i did a screenshot of earlier today with the pre mark and so there's your pre mark when they replaced this pole and if we go into gis so pole thirty five so the street view here was twenty nineteen and so it looks like they have the old pole and they have a new pole in here as well and one stuff now if you come into gis and click on the pole and you go to the editor tab you can see that that pole was set in twenty eighteen so that kind of makes sense as to why that looks fairly new and so we must called or someone must have calledo replace the pole with a forty this must have been a thirty five and then someone went out and said oh we're replacing this pole let's put a big white arrow there and that is essentially the pre mark that we're calling for on poles there was an anchor that needed to be installed you know we would specify you know set anchor ten feet or whatever to the east or southeast and there would be a stake in the general area where that would be as part of that pre mark note that when they do the cut and kicks or same hole set in new england they put the pole right into the same hole and then they bolted the other one to the old pole now we're looking at twenty nineteen here new got some interesting what is that like rope or insulators holding up it looks like street view would caught this in the middle of installation because the riser that's here doesn't appear to have been doesn't seem to have been installed yet in street view yet let's see nope it's there it's there oh it just hasn't connected to secondary yet so the risers there in street view hooks over but you can see the legs are just kind of attach i know that maybe they are attached they are attached it's just kind of looped down and dripped these little silver things are just like where they kind of it's like a compression i think compressions it's not compressor sp but it's like a connector between the wires and the taps coming off or the leads coming off triplex here al right so we need to replace our realar world objects in the case of this particular pole we'm going to be replacing the pole itself that's a realar world object we're going to be replacing the down guy that's a realar world object and then even though it says transfer and extend it's really just a replacement so we're also going to be replacing the riser here as well so how do we do that i'm do the pole first i think i set forty five two so i'm going to come over here i'm going to change the height forty five i didn't actually leave a two as is and i'm going just hit the replace button who is removing the old pole this is pretty much always going to be telephone for a joint own pole and then while i'm at this point i like to make sure that my setbys are all set so the replace remove setb this is related to who's removing the old pole should be should be telephone change that there all right so there's the pole poles been done let's also do the anchored down guy so the anchored down guy when we replace down guys we're not actually replacing the anchor itself we have to go into the anchored guy wire folder and that is what's getting replaced so the anchored down guy isn't going to actually show as a replacement as a gis object because it's within the anchor itself just going to replace this with itself so theing anchor stays existing it's the down guy that gets replaced and last but not least is the riser now one of the things you might have noticed is that the riser is hidden behind our pole replacement it's there if you click on the pole and cycle through it's hidden behind the scenes so there is a way to actually get that to show up on top of the pole object because when we export our sketches you can't really tell that there's a riser object there and that it's being replaced on the sketches so what we can do is and we'll probably have to remember to do this again once we actually export sketches is we can actually bring we can actually manipulate how the objects are going to appear in gis and in this case we're going to bring the riser forward a level so that way it appears on top of the pole so to do that we're going go into object control and i'm going to scroll down to riser okay i'm going right click on it and then there's a bring forward option and when you click on that it adds a one and bring forward again adds a two send back so basically it's just the level that we're setting it so you can actually go in and modify like how objects are displaying in relation to one another really the only one we're dealing with now with this is going to be the riser i brought it forward once and now it shows on top of the pole now i will need to remember to do that again when i go to export my sketches so i'm going to add a note here bring forward riser before exporting sketches because i'm going to forget that and then i'm going to export my sketches and go well wait a minute where's my riser so let's replace the riser pole riser just going to go ahead and replace that now our real world objects have been addressed for the pole replacement now we can go in and generate our work records i' select the pole i'm going go pole leng span editor and i'm going to generate work records this is the rebuild that we never want to click i want to hit create new not really ever using the delete and the renum i used to use it but that got me all sorts of confused so it's generally just the create new run and now i created work point three so i have that expanded and i'm going to expand all of these cost units so i can see everything that i have to work with and then what i'm going to do is i will minimize these folders as i've already looked at the cost unit so that way it kind of keeps track of in my mind what i've looked at what i have to still look at so any questions so far to where i've gotten no right all right so first thing first i'm going to do the pole and it's going to be the removal and so with the removal with the pole removal we want that cost unit to have the dashed jo on it which is there so i'm going to add the cuto top to the pole removal as well so i just want to drill into that folder that already has a costumit in so i'm just going to have that folder selected and then hit the edit button and that will open up that poll folder moveval and then right click add and then go back into my excel sheet and i'm looking for pos and there's a cuto top and this is a labor adder this is just adding labor to the job it has no materials associated with it and so let's see if i right click go to the report actual report there it is hiding so that represents point eight two hours added to the job tied to cutting off the top of the pole and when they cut the top off you they'll pull this old pole out stick the new pole in the hole transfer all the electric assets over to the new pole and then once all the electric assets are transformed transferred over they cut the top off and wait for the electric i mean wait for the communications to transfer over to the new pole as you can see with this read view doesn't look like any of the communications had transferred over but i do believe if i look at this in lci i pull thirty five i look at this pole in lci should be able to see it all right and then we go to measure load images and you can see that the double wood is gone so they've already addressed it in the time between twenty nineteen and now the cons have all transferred over to the new pole and the double wood is gone all right so' going to hit apply this is one that you'll use for every pole replacement so you're going to want to have that's definitely one to add to your favorites i have a pole replacement folder where i have all of my cost units that i use regularly for pole replacements all the ones nice bot including the dash which seems to always evade us okay i'm done with the pole removal so i'm going to close that minimize that folder now i'm ready to move on to the pole install that's where we're setting a forty five two the install is not going to have the dash jo unless telephone woulds installing it and that's only going to happen on half of nantucket and we don't really see too many apps in nantucket i remember when when we got a bunch of apps i i think because nantucket's an island off the coast of massachusetts so they have to take a ferry to get out there and so like in order to survey they had to take a ferry out to nantucket yeah so nantucket's the only one where cal would be potentially setting the poes in new england there might be a couple oddball scenarios hanging out there but ninety nine percent of the time it's going to be electric setting the pole here so we do not need the dash jo on this to go into that folder and then this is where i'm going to add the same whole set and then those pesky cost units related to penciling a white reflector all of that fun stuff so i have these in my favorites so pole replacement i'm going to do same whole set this is the pwr w that is the white reflector that we're adding on every pole replacement so i'm going to add that note how when you have your favorites it's just kind of run right through up select apply select apply just takes a lot of that hunt and pecking out of the process let's see pnwp pw rw pp two way is the ng tag add one of those and then the pnwp is the labor associated with stenciling apparently it takes a lot of labor to nail in some stencils but and then for numbers the poll number is thirty five so we're going to be adding a po a three and a five so three and five awesome i'm going go back in check my description of work it looks like everything else can be handled elsewhere so i got the pole install holder all set now too in mind next up i'm going to look at the primary primary overhead so descriptional work is listing nine dash four twelve poull top and transfer primary gis auto generated a nine dash four thirteen so let's go into go into my standards manual so we can actually look and see what the difference is between a nine dash four twelve and a nine dash four thirteen it's likely the line angle at nine dash four thirteen eleven to twenty degrees is the nine dash four thirteen pole top what nine dash four thirteen covers single phase delta lines or three phase cross arm eleven to twenty and it looks like it's also a single as well but we're crossing the road and it's actually a double four twelve is the double cross arm which is great and it's for line angles zero to ten which is what our line angle is because we've we're calling for that although that does kind of look like there's more of a line angle in gis so i'm just going leave it because it is the double cross arm so i'm going to change the nine dash four thirteen as' to nine dash four twelve a' okay so these autoenate based on what's in gis and also that also includes like the covering on the primary wire so if we click on the primary here and you go to editor it's going to tell us to go into overhead primary wires the insulation on this wire the covering is bare there is no insulation or covering okay and so the poull top configurations have that information usually within the configuration selected so if this was covered wire if this was anything besides bare it could be tw for tree wire could be pe for pe covering i can't remember what the pe stands for but if it is covered these would autoenate with a c at the end so it would have been nine dash four thirteen a c or nine dash seven fifteen b c the cl indicates that we're dealing with covered line i don't usually double check that i usually just hey if it auto generates a cl version of the pull top configuration and i need to replace it with something else i'm replacing it with the cl version with the poull top configuration standard that i need here we're just looking at it's just the nine dash four thirteen a that is the standard you look up top here look at the top nine dash four thirteen a or b a is for three phase b would have been for single phce okay i'm going swap these out for a nine dash four twelve because that that more accurately represents what we're looking at here because we do have the double cross arm okay and that's also what we're calling for in the design nine dash four twelve so primary going select that and i'm going to go into the edit and so i'm just going to right click add co in my white space and go to poullopk conf figs i probably don't have itit in there so let's go into here and so let's search for this macro and macros usually start out with the ampersam or the no that's not an ampersand that's an at at nine dash four one two a uncheck the group and then it gives us the options so there's your covered version of this line if we wanted the covered version we're just going to go with this one install move and i'm going to get rid of the thirteen and then for the transfer we're transferring primary that's greater than a two ought to four ought size so that's a really large wire size i have a table that will that helps me occasionally when i'm trying to figure out like what the sizes are let me make this a little bit bigger there boom so four oug is bigger than a one ought two ought so on and so forth and then once you get down to a one ought the numbering goes the other direction we go one two three so a two is going to be bigger than a four a four is bigger than a six so on and so forth as far as wire size so the higher up this way the bigger the wire the further down in the list the smaller the wire you go and so four ought is pretty big the transfer that we're calling for is a two ought to four oug and if we went into primary again the overhead wires it's calling it four ought so that cost unit makes sense that auto generated correctly i'm going to go ahead and minimize that okay coming right along here all right now we're going to look at the guying and so three cost unit folders just populated related to that one is anchor and guy that's tied to the anchor we're not replacing an anchor you can actually just go in and delete that folder altether you don't need a transfer cost unit tied to that anchor they're not doing anything with it i got to actually select the folder go into here right click remove so that folder's gone now the other folders that were auto generated we have an anchored guy wire tied to the removal of the existing wire that's good and then we have an install for the new wire that's good now if this is that real world example i was telling you about where if we ended up accidentally deleting this down guy cost unit this folder would go away and then we're like oh well how do i get it back let me just add it to the poull folder add this cost unit small world will still will freak out saying that there is no cost unit associated with this action because it was looking for we called for ingis to replace the down guy but we don't have a folder in a cost unit associated with that action that's why with the real world objects those are the going to be primarily the the folders that we're going to want to make sure we're putting specific cus into that looked that are being looked for basically so we're removing the existing down guy wire and installing a new one cool what else i can minimize the pole secondary secondary is transfer secondary ten one hundred fig two that's the pr one sts we had an install and removal of that and then we're just transferring a generic triplex secondary that's good too moving on to the riser which has some fun c use okay so riser removal don't even need to add anything to it 's the install that we're adding stuff to and so when we're going to be adding riser let's look at the description of work here so transfer and extend riser for this standard to thirty one eight thirty one five the riser cu itself will have let's see what that actually does have just taling here let's see let's go and look for it so we can see the material report to see what's actually associated with this particular cost unit this is service connect see let's see okay so this particular cost unit for installing this riser has all of this stuff in it it has looks like a tie a holder or for tags' so all kinds of tape leader connector and it also has the u guard which we're all probably mostly familiar with when we're looking at risers so the cu that auto generated tied to the replacement of that riser already has the u guard in the cost unit so we don't need to add that but we do need to add get a tag going to add our cable our cable tags tied to that underground service and then we're going to need to foam seal the riser cable tags i don't think these are going to be in your in this i might have to i might need to add a section here in here which i can all right so for cable tags pull up a one note let see i was learning so the first like bunch of years i every important email or everything that i would come up with that was you know i thought was useful i would add to this one note that i can then go through and search for notes about and so i have a bit of a information all kinds of information in here i don't use it as much because it's a lot of the stuff now is muscle memory but every once in a while i need to come in here and go what was that and that's the cable tags is actually one of those ones so let's go in and find that cable cable tagging all right and so this is what the cable tags are going to look like on secondary cables it's going to either be either going to be an n or c n being national grid c being customer and then we're going to have to add the individual stencils related to the service that the riser is going to so in this case it's going to number four and so if i come back into two this riser to that group hey hey zeke zeke sorry my cats are doingi get out of there don't do that you're being mean to yourself three cats and i have a male that's trying to assert his dominance over the female so they kind of all go after each other all right so back into here so we're going to need to add cost units for the actual tag itself which is this metal piece with the screws we're going to have to add cost units for the individual stencils that are going on the tag and then there's actually two different types of tags this holds actually six up to six numbers or letters and then there's one that holds ten but depending on the size of the basically the number that the service is feeding will potentially dictate that we need a larger size i feel like this stuff is kind of silly so like a lot of these cus are what we like to call work order truck stock where they're on the trucks already so if we missed the wrong stencil size or we didn't have the right number chances are somewhere on their truck they're going to have pole stencils or they're going to have a stencil holder and so a lot of times we just kind of chalk that kind of stuff up to as truck stock in case you know you like if we're splicing in additional cable to raise secondary we would consider that cable truck stock because chances are they probably have a big spool of the wire on the truck already back to this little sidetrack here add and i'm actually just going to go to my favorites because i do have all of these handy i'm going go to my risers section and so this is the cctn is the tag holder it's covered it has six digits and then the cctn is the ten digit one so i'm just going to add the six because we don't need a ton of digits in the tag i'm going to add one of those i'm going to put customer owned because this is customer service so we're going to go to customer owned and then we're going to put the number in this case it's a four note that these are different numbers from the stencils that are getting added to the pole these are yellow numbers whereas the pole tag stencils are like metal gray numbers hammered into the pole add the four here as well so and that's it for the stencil where basically when they come in here and they transfer that new wire over you know they're going to add a tag either up here or probably just up there somewhere that notes that hey this is where this riser is going and then the other thing that we need to add is the spray foam which in the description to work was foam seal raised riser this is one of those weird cus that needs to be in a very specific folder it needs to be in the riser folder so i'm just i actually have it right here cuf pen spray foam i'm going to call for an install there back into my description of work and then just kind of look over and see if i covered everything so so let's see i've replaced the pole we've done the pole top configuration done the down guy we did the riser which included the tag and the foam seal and then we've also called to transfer secondary as well so i've got all the cost units that i needed here so what i'm going to do now so they appear here or when i'm doing my construction sketches is i'm going to add the annotation associated with replacing the pole usually wait to do this until after i've added the cost units and you go to select the pole go to editor specials add work order ano going to do the same thing' going to go to the replace remove object specials add work order ano now i have them both i have my insertion points noted that's the little square and so i can actually we' click draw our box to select both of them and then move them around as i want to now if you were trying to save time you could potentially go in and add your streets you if maybe this was a street name but i'm just going to leave all of that like that oh what else do we need here oh we because we're working in the primary zone we got show what the wire size is for primary and we do that with a wire annotation and that lives within the primary overhead object so we have the primary wire selected and then i go to wire annotations at the bottom and i click on that there's a button that shows over here on the right called create new object going click on that that will create a new work order i mean wire ano object we can just grab the defaults and insert it's like i need to put a trail point here first or trail so let's go ahead and i'm going to draw a trail line on how i want it to display like where i want to display i want to display it on this side of primary maybe so i'll draw a line in the and how i want to read it and the direction i want to read it and i'm going to go to this annotation create new we have to change this to existing update and so now we have that primary wire annotation and again i can i have my insertion point so i can move that around as i needed to it probably looks better over there and then last but not least i'm going to add my feeder number got a pole replacement and it looks like the feeder number is actually way down here because in new england oftentimes you have really long you often have one object that represents primary across it looks like one two three four five six seven eight nine spans is covered by this one primary object whereas in new york you would have nine individual objects of primary so l the feeder and voltage ano is associated with the primary overhead folder unfortunately you're only able to add one of these at a time for a primary span so i've noted that there is it's already here there's already the feeder number and the line voltage and i beta that's you know that number there yep it is and then the line voltage same deal it's there so what i'm just going to do is i'm going to just drag those up to my pole because it's the same line here it's like i just have to go back in and re update these so feeder number i want that to appear like this update that and line number like that not line number volt line voltage can't talk what do i do you know what i don't think i saved that i did i gott to go back in re add my trail and then save it awesome and so now i've done my pole replacement or pole thirty five and i have that note there about bringing the riser forward before exporting construction sketches we want to skip ahead oh no actually no this is another pole replacement but i do want to look at this one in street view because this one had lots of tree trimming so it's a good example'll show you kind of how i went through my thought process on tree trimming for this all right so twenty five poull replacement pull top config we had a primary down guy we're replacing an actual service let's look at it in street view peak and so then our pole is actually this guy here again the the imagery is from twenty nineteen but it's what we got i mean lci for this pole so let's go into lci i already have it but and so yeah you got one view looking at it that angle clearly don'one of you guys noticed that but something's missing there between the house and the pole this big ass tree is not there so that's good to see so there is definitely differences well like if i didn't look at lci would have been like oh well we definitely need tree trimming on the service because if you look at the service it's tapping coming down and then you can see it looks like it's sitting on the limb of the tree before then going down into the house so they must have removed that at some point so it looks like i don't have to worry about tree trimming on the service that's good but it's the other spans because we don't really have a lot to work with we have this which kind of shows it which of shows it crossing the street really it's hard to see hard to tell what sort of clearance or how far things are related to the wire so we have to use street view we have to just kind of keep in mind that you know it's dated generally i would say to err on the side of over calling for tree trimming rather than under calling for it because they can always just go out in the field and say no no tree trimming is actually needed and that would be good they reviewed it and we know the answer to that question whereas if we didn't call it and we actually did moot it that might have to put a delay into the project itself so it's always better to over call for it if you are on the fence i would say call for it and so we've already established that this service was that tree is gone so i don't have to worry about the tree trimming there but we're replacing this pole and so we're replacing it with i think a forty five as soon as i see trees potentially overhead of my wires i'm going to call for trimming in both of those spans because there are going to be clearances associated with where those tree branch limbs will be in relation to raised cross arm i want to see it's potentially eight feet up and of you can't really gauge where that tree i mean i mean that tree's not actually there at this point now but you can't really gauge where the trees are in relation to you know the wires so whenever i see overhanging wires on my lines or over my lines and i'm raising primary i probably call for tree trimming so this span i'm calling for it decided that this tree isn't there based on lci so i'm not nearly as worried about that i think that tree is gone and any of my overhead stuff on that span is gone but there's this tree overhead that looks like it's probably a concern potentially this little guy over here might be again twenty nineteen it's six years ago i'm calling for tree trimming on this span the span to the south also sometimes it does blur it out like this but span to the south it kind of comes through i see trees overhanging and then it crosses the road to it looks like this pole over here clearly this is going through trees there so it needs to be reviewed for all i know those trees aren't there now but based on the information we have in front of us i am over calling tree trimming and calling for it on that side because there's trees present so north of the pole south of the pole also calling for it for the tap the tap is going to coming off of the pole here coming across and actually it looks like it's hung up in the tree branch here if you look back at it the tree is kind of wrapped around it the wires within that tree branch i don't know if that's still like that because we don't really have that view with our photos you know we can't see that far over to the left so i'm going to call for tree trimming on that span as well tree trimming this span to the south cross street and then also i'm going to call for tree trimming at the pole related to we're going to have to replace a down guy have to replace that wire i don't know if they're going to really be able to get in there also there might be again it's hard to tell where the trees one tree ends and the other one begins but it's close enough there to warrant that we're going to i'm going to call for tree trimming here as well i'm going to pause there i'm going to stop sharing because we do have a call at eleven i would like to take a quick little break before then so we're going to pause there have our meeting and then we can touch base after if we want to continue working through this are folks finding this valuable yeah super valu absolutely okay good so then yeah we'll probably end up picking up with this again later on today after our meetings and so on and so forth so grab something grab a break and eleven o'clock work new england call and i'll talk to you guys then sounds good
