They are mounted on poles and designed for outdoor exposure, complying with NESC standards for safety, reliability, and environmental factors. Section 14 checklists indicate detailed specs on pages 14-1 through 14-9, covering installation and types like single-phase (14-50 to 14-61) and three-phase banks."
