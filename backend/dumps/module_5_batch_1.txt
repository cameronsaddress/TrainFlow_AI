Surface oxidation and contaminants will greatly interfere with the establishment of a sound electrical connection. An insulating oxide naturally forms on all conductor surfaces exposed to air. Always thoroughly wire brush the conductors (both new conductors and conductors in service) before making connections. Never use the same wire brush to clean both an aluminum and copper conductor. Copper contaminants transferred to the aluminum conductor will cause the aluminum conductor to corrode."
