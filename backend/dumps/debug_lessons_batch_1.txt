LESSON_ID: Initiating and Managing GIS Work Orders
MODULE: Module 2: GIS Design Basics and Field Data Integration
TITLE: Initiating and Managing GIS Work Orders
CONTENT_SUMMARY: To begin working on a job in GIS, open the work order by browsing to the National Grid district and work order number. Right-click the file in DM Admin, select take ownership, and click in white space to confirm. Double-click to open, then go to File > Change State > Proposed to enable editing.

After CUs, add WO annotations via Editor > Specials > Add WO Anno on pole/replace objects. For primary, add wire/line voltage annos. Bring riser forward (Object Control) before sketches.

Save frequently as GIS may kick out; most changes persist. After edits, File > Change State in GIS > Design Complete to post to server. File becomes read-only; recreate if more changes needed. Estimates sent to Storms; handle messages by marking read/delete.

Follow the NGrid Make Ready Work Order Process: Setup local folder, send GIS design. For GIS Update and Prep: (4a) Open GIS Pole Selection, (4b) Generate Cost Units for Real World Objects (RWOs), (4c) Manually Create Work Point, (4d) Review Cost Units, (4e) Add Descriptions to Smallworld. Then Construction Sketch: (5a) Setting Up, (5b) Creating Indexes, (5c) Updating Sketches, add annotation, save sketch. Check for poles, anchors/guys, services, risers, span guys, secondary conductors, XFMRs, major equipment.

Statuses transition from 'Existing' and 'Operating' to 'Closed' across joined records (e.g., 26728951 Existing TUrk). Boundary data (ABINGTON town) and coordinates are verified. Design completion triggers 'Merge and Post Design' job success messages: 'Job "Merge and Post Design" succeeded for Design "COMCAST AB-25-601_FA2"'. Instructions note rollforward and refresh. This integrates all field data into a postable design, ready for construction.

During the Work Order Training session in Microsoft Teams, team members share critical resources such as the coMCAST AD Work Order Resources Folder located under NationalGrid-Engineering > ProjectData > FieldData. Additionally, links to TSProjectFiles > NationalGrid > NationalGrid BAUIO1 - Project > MG IW > Specifications > WO Training are shared. Megan Gambrell asks if today's video can be downloaded and uploaded, confirmed by the team. This demonstrates how field data and project specifications are collaboratively accessed prior to GIS design and integration.

The screen transitions from the Teams meeting to the Intranet Helix ALM - NGrid Application Tracking interface. This tool is used for tracking utility applications, including those requiring GIS design. It shows dashboards, applications, workbooks, folders, and queues like Work Order Queue - NY @ Design Approvals, Work Order QC, and Work Order Queue - NE GENERAL INQUIRIES TAB. This step is essential for designers to verify field data from applications before GIS integration.

In Helix ALM, a specific application #31172749 for COMCAST AB-25-601 in Abington, MA on Brockton Ave is reviewed. Details include status 'Work Order Written, assigned - Hicks, Alicia', applicant Comcast Communications, entered 6/26/2025, WR_No: 31172749, TELCO: VERIZON, Number of Poles, Lidar Available, and project funding info. This application data serves as field data input for GIS design processes.

The workflow events for the application show steps like Reassign 11/10/2025 to Hicks Alicia, PLA QC completed, telco reconciliation with Pike Telecom, HRE Design Complete 8/14/2025. Find Results display 47 items in queues, listing apps like COMCAST AB-25-601 assigned to Hicks Alicia (137 days), with statuses 'Work Order Being Written, assigned', towns, days in queue, and assignees like Boak Jonathan, Castellar Joshua. This queue review ensures field data readiness for GIS integration.

Cross-reference GIS coordinates (e.g., 42.342600,-73.254900) with Google Maps and Street View for pole locations like 49 East St, Lenox, MA. Confirm visual details such as pole positions, nearby structures, and vegetation encroachment using dated imagery from 2019.

Evaluate tree trimming using street view (even if dated 2019), survey photos, and forestry standards requiring 18-inch clearance for secondary. Err on over-calling to flag potential needs; forestry team verifies in field. Note branches impacting spans or work areas, especially wooded lines with growth over time. Add notes like 'TT northwest side' in E5.

Classify pole access as roadside (police protection), off-road (truck off road like parking lots, possibly police if crossing roads), or rear lot (no truck access, extra costs via track machines/UTVs). For Walmart parking lot, note 'off road work' in bold on E5; assume no flagging/police unless specified.

Identify risers (primary, secondary, coms), down guys, cutouts (line vs transformer, with fuse tubes/brackets), lightning arresters, terminations. Note 3-phase primary, cutouts (3-65T), for cost units. Check CSV for image/anchor shots.

GIS field integration flags tree trimming needs, like 274 Jox Tree Trimming Required at pole 22130749, with notes to raze secondary and achieve clearances. This data drives forestry work orders, linking field observations to design actions.

GIS design uses Google Street View Sep 2019 at 42°05'47.2"N 70°58'02.4"W for Abington MA, Brockton Ave pole verification. Coordinates like Centre 2734603' 10,55.2192793 aid precise field data georeferencing and visual confirmation.

For Roadside Work, where truck parks on or partially on road using 15' bucket reach: Simply add 'Police Protection Required' to DOW on construction sketches. No extra Cost Units (CUs) needed. Police protection calculated from Smallworld labor hour estimates sent to STORMS.

Off Road Work: Pole accessible by truck and 15' reach, but requires off-road travel across grass, fields, or private property (with permission). Add 'Off Road Work' in bold to ES/C-form and construction sketch. May require police protection if work involves conductors crossing roadway.

Rear Lot Work: Pole not accessible by truck/15' arm due to heavy woods, wetlands, steep grade, fences; may need climbing or ATV. You wouldn't drive your car there. Add 'Rear Lot Work' in bold to ES/C-form and sketch, plus Rear Lot Labor Adder CUs. May require police if conductors cross roadway.

Surveyors like Washington Ivan, Gambrell Megan, Castellar Joshua, Boak Jonathan, Leo Stephen, and Hicks Alicia A are logged with dates like Aug 2025 survey, Jul install, notes on location complete, tree trimming required, off-road work, linking field personnel to GIS records for accountability and follow-up.

Field photos RIMG8853.JPG to RIMG8892.JPG from 7/17/2025 capture pole conditions along the route, viewed alongside GIS layers, supporting visual verification of make-ready needs like guy anchors, X-arms, and tree encroachments for accurate design integration.

From the Work_Description StyleSheet, standard phrases include 'Raise secondary XX" to XX'X" (10-100 Fig 1) resulting in XX" clearance to primary', 'Double deadend secondary and raise XX" to XX'X" (10-101 Fig 5)', 'Resag secondary between poles XX and XX to provide no less than 42" clearance from existing top comm at midspan'. Drip loops must be at least 6", ideally 8-10", and add splices as necessary (5-144).

NGrid_CUsAH-Lite lists devices like PRISTS SECONDARY CLAMP 0-10 DEG (10-100 Fig 24), PRISTS-2 CLAMP 61 DEG, PRISTSTAP SECONDARY deadend tap, Secondary Splicing (CICSP ONE CONDUCTOR SPLICE), labor adders like TLA CDLRECXFMR for drip loops. Service transfers: SER-SHORTSIDERTALLLAB, SER-TRIPZ,CL SHTSDLAB for #2 triplex shortside, materials AL/PE covered.

Field notes specify adjustments like 'Raise secondary 38" to 34'8" (10-100 Fig 2) resulting in 56" clearance to primary crossarm.' Existing: 120" 68"TPX 70' 258"TPX 2-2" Sec DL; required changes ensure NESC compliance. GIS updates reflect reconductoring, primary crossings (e.g., 39'4" Pn Xarm), and secondary taps (extend to P37-1). Integrate these into GIS by editing attachment heights and spans.

When raising secondary wire 12 inches per standard, the work involves installing a new bracket 12 inches higher, detaching the triplex from the old bracket, transferring it to the new one, and removing the old bracket. Capture these in cost units later. Always verify tree trimming needs independently.

LESSON_ID: Primary Risers and Underground Cable Management
MODULE: Module 3: Advanced GIS Modeling and Cost Unit Management
TITLE: Primary Risers and Underground Cable Management
CONTENT_SUMMARY: Replaced risers may hide behind new pole. Right-click riser in Object Control > Electric Objects > Riser > Bring Forward to layer it visibly above the pole. Note this on E5 as it resets per session.

Check UG primary arrangement (dashed conductor): Direct Buried uses 18-2xx styles. If existing riser pipe present, omit new steel sweep/pipe. Provide extra UG wire (pole height length, e.g., 45ft #2 Al XLPE 1C), direct bury splices. Conduit differs (replace to manhole).

In advanced GIS modeling for utility pole replacements involving primary risers, always check the Primary UG Arrangement field in the GIS system to dictate the handling method. The most common arrangement is Direct Buried, referenced as standard 18.2.20. This is found under fields like Number of Conductors and Arrangement in the CO List Object Relationships.

When the primary underground cable away from the pole is direct buried, replacing the cable from the pole to an existing access point requires excavation. Galvanized steel sweep and riser pipe are required for all risers. Install these items when relocating terminations on the pole if they were not previously installed.

To minimize required excavation for primary risers on direct buried cables, direct bury the splices: splice new cables to existing cables near the base of the pole beyond the underground end of the riser sweep pipe. There is also a Direct Buried option on the stylesheet. If enough room around the pole, use direct buried splices but run enough UG cable from phase terminations to the splices.

In advanced GIS modeling for utility projects, the underground primary arrangement in GIS dictates how to handle primary riser poles. Check the Primary UG Arrangement field in GIS; the most common is Direct Buried, referenced under 18.2.20. This determines work requests like replacements or extensions.

For direct buried primary UG cables away from the pole, replacing cable from pole to access point requires excavation. Install galvanized steel sweep and riser pipe per 18.8.20 if not previously installed, especially when relocating terminations on the pole.

To minimize excavation for direct buried cables, direct bury the splices: splice new cables to existing near pole base beyond underground end of riser sweep pipe per 18.8.20A. Tag new cables per 18.2.20. This is an example option with cost, time, and rework impact.

Foam seal raised risers per 18.6. Common items include transfer non-porcelain 100A cutout and replace XXK fuse link (18-125), replace L3ER 12K arrester (13-115), replace 1PH primary riser (18-125), pole replacement, replace single down ground (13-111).

Stylesheet options: Install U-guard to extend riser (18-125), splice on pole per 18.8.10, replace cables to manhole per 18.8.10, direct bury splices per 18.8.20A. If existing riser pipe/conduit at pole base, steel sweep/riser not required.

For primary risers, split macros to access CUs. Transfer non-porcelain cutout bodies (CC15K-1, qty 3), replace fuse links (CFLK25K, confirm size via E5 or GIS voltage like 25kV), replace brackets (PBCA), grounding verticals (CSVG single/double), terminations, U-guards. Add spray foam, lightning arresters if on terminator brackets (PE12M fiberglass mounts). Always replace fuse links on cutout transfers; note outage implications for primary risers.

For primary risers, tag each phase (A/B/C) with 6-digit holders (CCTN), numbers (CUP21N for 43-1 pad: 4,3,-,1,2 transformer pad tag). Qty 3 sets for 3-phase; place in riser folder. No separate labor adder like pole stenciling.

The process includes tagging new cables 'Tag new cables Ref 18 ? ?0' and applying foam seal raised per Der 13. These are UNDEFINED CUs added to secondary services, with attachments like neutral at 28 ft height, modeling customer service extensions accurately.

TITLE: Overhead and Primary Conductors
CONTENT_SUMMARY: To provide UG primary length: Insert Reference Point (Object Control > type 'Reference Point', town/tax/line details) on actual route, snap to wire. Trail from vertex to existing route, select primary > Specials > Split. Replace split section (add 3x #2 Al XLPE 1C installs), add direct bury splice.

In Object Overview for secondary conductors (155101C55, Existing IW Overhead), edit fields: Number of conductors, Secondary Size, Material Type, Insulation, Neutral Size (AAAC), Arrangement NA, MH 3-25K. Calculated lengths like 223' 9.65", phase wire count, encumbrances support cost unit modeling for UG/OH transitions and risers.

The GIS editor is used to configure primary UG cable details. Fields include status existing, loadbreak switch open 998, division IW, no NGRID work, management direct buried, direction DB, cable number N/A or specific like 1-271293, phasing ABC, voltage 13.8kV, distribution type unknown or ELCO, insulation APE or rating 15kV, concentric neutral, kind type XLPE 15kV concentric unknown, jacket material, route unknown, actual/calculated length. Notes reference PRIMARY RISER ELCO at 45/2 pole same hole set, highway private public, ownership National Grid. Multiple spans are added with unique cable numbers like 14271293, 14271294, 14271295, showing joined records.

The interface demonstrates Trail Mode for precise span editing between poles. Users create trails from selections, reverse trails, offset trails, and zoom to trails. Segment lengths, bearings (e.g., 115 53 45.5"), and coordinates update dynamically (e.g., 2611302 10.75 to 2173608 10.58). This is key for modeling accurate overhead electric cable paths in 13.8kV distribution lines, calculating actual vs. calculated lengths for cost estimation.

Attributes for electric lines are updated, including Feeder Name (FVR-1, Grove Roadside), Voltage Class (13.8kV BOS 9722 4), Conductor Number (3m3), and Phasing (ABC). Operating status (Normal), ownership (National Grid), and encumbrances are managed. Annotations for feeder numbers and small-scale feeders ensure data integrity for cost unit management and network modeling.

Advanced tools like Add Change Point, Offset, Delete Point are used in Point/Span Editor. For spans, modifications include 'Change Point (2083, Tbmah cl-arim Dunol spans', ensuring clear views in SV. This refines geometry for precise cost calculations per unit length in GIS modeling.

In this clip, observe how the GIS editor changes the status of an underground primary wire feature from 'Existing' to 'Replace'. This is crucial for make-ready processes where existing infrastructure needs replacement for new attachments. The field is located in the attribute inspector, and the change triggers updates in related object relationships. Note the timestamped saves and the impact on joined records.

Key attributes for UG primary wires are edited here, including size '3-#2', insulation 'XLPE', concentric neutral 'CN', voltage '13.8kV', and phasing 'ABC'. These updates reflect triplex/neutral configurations confirmed in notes ('sec thats triplexlneutral'). This modeling ensures accurate cost estimation for replacement materials in advanced GIS workflows.

The interface displays related poles (e.g., GIS ID 13508129) and joined records (e.g., 1240214725, 1240214726). Editing wire status propagates to relationships, showing poles located in districts and DB injections. Use the 'List Object Relationships' to verify impacts on primary UG wires and associated structures during make-ready.

At the bottom of the screen, trail analysis tools display segment length, bearing, X/Y coordinates (e.g., 42.07415,-71.422447), total length, and area. This advanced feature aids in precise modeling of spans for cost unit calculations, with updates reflecting edited actual vs. calculated lengths (e.g., MH 4, 3-25K).

Footer displays 'Segment length Segment Ecarng Kcpordinatc cocroinic Traliengtn ri Jma', with values like 2272**0 _ 0 05 0 * | 41. Tracks trail area, coords for spans (e.g., 3-42 XLPE AL CN). Core to advanced GIS for quantifying work units and costs.

In this GIS session, the user demonstrates transferring multiple overhead conductor spans, specifically 3 conductors, using labor codes like CU <CI-1C326477LABR TALL. This operation is repeated across spans, associating cost units for labor tracking in advanced modeling. Select the conductor object, navigate to the operation menu, choose Transfer, specify quantity <3>, and link the labor code for accurate cost unit management.

Editing primary overhead wire involves fiecr phase field at CU <CI-ICLT7SPCRL4BRAALL, setting phasing like CBA, voltage 13.8kV, and arrangement spaced spacer RP1. Use the Phase Field editor, Point Span Editor, and attributes panel to update number of conductors 3-25k, ensuring accurate modeling for National Grid feeders.

LESSON_ID: Arresters, Cutouts, Fuses, and Grounding
MODULE: Module 3: Advanced GIS Modeling and Cost Unit Management
TITLE: Arresters, Cutouts, Fuses, and Grounding
CONTENT_SUMMARY: Install arresters in four common scenarios: 1. Per 13.6.30A, primary wire transitions from bare to covered/tree wire/spacer cable or vice versa at the transition pole; weatherproof conductors count as bare; required when touching primary. 2. Per 13.6.40A, taps with fused cutouts need arresters; existing within 300 feet downstream satisfy; all phases, e.g., 3PH line with 1PH XFMR needs two more; required when touching cutouts. 3. Per 13.6.40C, disconnect switches need arresters on adjacent poles; existing within 300 feet satisfy; all phases; required when touching switches or replacing adjacent pole. 4. Per 13.6.40E, end-of-line deadends need arresters on pole; existing on pole satisfy; all phases. Text refs 13-110 to 13-10, drawings 13-111 to 13-116. Replace LJER 12K arresters as noted.

For wye circuits, call single down ground. For delta circuits, double down ground at poles with both arrester grounds AND secondary; otherwise single. If installing arresters on pole with existing down ground, replace it for continuity (no splices); existing may be too short for leads. Do not call to replace down ground twice when doing standalone arresters and equipment arresters (e.g., XFMRs). Replace arresters associated with equipment if not tank-mounted, and for primary risers (mark with 'R'). Replace single down ground per 13-111.

Per standard 13.6.40A, taps with fused cutouts require arresters to be installed. Existing line arresters or equipment with arresters, such as transformers, within 300 feet on the load side or downstream of the tap satisfy this requirement. All phase conductors require arresters. For example, a 3-phase primary line with a 1-phase transformer will require two additional arresters on the non-transformer phases. This requirement must be addressed when work requires touching the fused cutouts.

Per standard 13.6.40C, disconnect switches require arresters installed at the adjacent poles. Existing line arresters or equipment with arresters, like transformers, within 300 feet of the switches satisfy this. All phase conductors require arresters; for a 3PH primary with 1PH XFMR, add two on non-XFMR phases. Address when touching disconnect switches. If only replacing an adjacent disconnect switch, install arresters on that pole—existing ones do not satisfy.

Per 13.6.40E, end line deadends require arresters on the pole itself. Existing arresters or equipment like XFMR on the pole satisfy. All phase conductors need arresters; 3PH primary with 1PH XFMR requires two additional on non-XFMR phases. Address when work requires touching the primary.

Per 13.6.30A, primary wire transitions from bare to covered wire, tree wire, spacer cable, or vice versa require arresters at the pole with the transition. Weatherproof conductors are considered bare. Address when work requires touching the primary.

For wye circuits, use single down ground. For delta circuits, use double down ground at poles with both arrester grounds AND secondary on pole; otherwise single. If installing arresters on a pole with existing down ground, replace the down ground—Grid requires continuous ground with no splices, and existing may be too short. When placing poles with standalone arresters or equipment like XFMRs, do not replace down ground twice.

Call to replace arresters associated with equipment if not mounted to the equipment (e.g., XFMRs without tank-mounted arresters) when work requires touching the arrester. Also replace arresters associated with primary risers; riser arresters should have 'R' at the end of the pole.

In GIS edits for pole replacements, include items like: Replace LJER 12K arrester (13-115), replace 3PH primary riser (18-405), replace single down ground (13-111), install steel sweep and riser pipe per 18.8.20, direct bury splices to extend riser to 28' 4", tag new cables per 18.2.20, foam seal raised riser per 18, transfer triplex/neutral secondary per 10-100 Fig 2A.

Per 13.6.40A, taps with fused cutouts require arresters on all phase conductors. Existing line arresters or equipment like XFMR within 300' load side satisfy if covering phases. Install on non-XFMR phases if needed, e.g., 3PH with 1PH XFMR needs two more.

Per 13.6.40E, end of line deadends require arresters on all phase conductors. Existing on pole satisfy. Address when touching primary. For standalone arresters or equipment, replace associated arresters if touching them; riser arresters end in 'R' like LBER.

Wye circuits: single down ground. Delta: double at poles with arresters and secondary. Replace down ground if installing arresters on pole with existing ground for continuity. Do not replace twice for pole with equipment.

Remove <3> cutouts OH EDCCO <C> CCSCTISKZR, lightning arrester UDU-R <C> CU CciSKSI, fuses like 10K link (16-185) or 23K links (18-405). Codes like CALIZKRPNE for phase 43. Replace non-porcelain 100A cutouts during transfers, integrating into cost units.

CONTENT_SUMMARY: NGRID QAQC window is active, with tools like Trail Analyze, Edit View. Status checks (Existing, Proposed Writable), operating status (Normal), and flags (Out of Phase, Load Break) validate edits. Critical for advanced modeling compliance and cost unit accuracy.

In the NGRID QAQC tool, to remove grounding vertices, select the CUSCSVGUI option from the tools menu. Target specific components like EDCGR for grounding vertices associated with alternate CUs or primary wires. Confirm the removal in the object control editor, ensuring no undefined elements remain. This is visible across multiple timestamps where 'Renove Gonding Vertice EDCGR' appears repeatedly during QAQC edits on pole structures.

In the NGRID GIS tool, to prepare for riser pole replacement, first remove bonding vertices using CU__CSVGUJ. This is shown in the object editor where EDCGRACAL indicates grounding vertices removal. Similarly, remove grounding vericles like CSVGUJ and single vertical ground/bond 1170. These steps clear existing configurations before new installations, as seen in the repeated edits at timestamps around 1130s.

In the GIS object overview for a floating riser phase, locate the grounding vertex CU such as CUSCSVGUI or CSVGUJ. Select the remove operation to delete the bonding vertex like EDCGRAC<Create or EDCGRA<C2AL. This is shown in the CO list where operations are applied to specific instances.

During operations, watch for validation results like 'warning- cLOU_ung CU CFLK25 may cause Former accounting'. Confirm to complete the operation despite warnings when appropriate.

NGRID QAQC tools review object relationships, fields like pole no. 10EC477 or 1062477, work types (replace arresters, cutouts, fuse links), and attachments. Process documents, streetlight ownership, and work order resources ensure data integrity for advanced modeling and cost management.

MODULE: Module 5: Compliance and Notification Documentation
TITLE: Dig Safe Tickets: Rules, When Required, and Grouping
CONTENT_SUMMARY: Dig Safe forms are required for digging work such as pole replacements, anchor installations/replacements, ground rod installations/replacements, push brace installations/replacements. Complete one Dig Safe for each unique set of intersecting streets for non-contiguous poles, maximum three poles per form. Copy NE DigSafeX from work order resources/ds_noe folder to local folder. Fill blue top section: WO number (e.g., DISTTPTYA WO), Department performing work from STORMS Crew HQ (e.g., MONSON Overhead), County from STORMS or GIS, Lat/Long from construction sketches or multiple see below, Municipality (e.g., Monson), Street address from GIS/Google Maps (e.g., 36 Fern Hill Road), Cross streets (e.g., Stateab east, dead end west), Method of pre-mark: painted for poles/push braces, staked for anchors/ground rods. NRID use only: simple. Design investigator: name and phone. Bottom green section: Nature of work - pole number, coordinates, replace pole, location relative to house/address (e.g., south side of road 300 ft east of 36 Fern Hill Road house). Nearest house address 36, max distance 500 ft.

In National Grid make ready processes, Dig Safe tickets are required specifically for digging-related electric work. This includes NGrid set pole installations or replacements, NGrid set anchor installations or replacements, ground rod installations or replacements, and push brace installations or replacements. Non-digging work does not require Dig Safes.

Dig Safe forms must be completed for each unique set of intersecting streets and for each pole that is not contiguous with others. A maximum of three poles can be included on a single Dig Safe form. For example, when replacing multiple poles marked in red along a route, create separate Dig Safes: Dig Safe 1 for Poles 1, 1-1, and P2 all between Marquette St and Greenwood St; Dig Safe 2 for P3 between Greenwood St and Regan St; Dig Safe 3 for P4 and P5 both between Regan St and Nichols St.

The Dig Safe Capture form is split into sections using columns. Fill out the top section in blue, which is required in all areas, and the bottom section in green, which is specific to NE only. Orange fields are for NY only. Notes emphasize completing both blue top and green bottom sections for NE projects.

Dig Safe must be completed for each unique set of intersecting streets and for each pole not contiguous. Maximum of three contiguous poles can be included on one Dig Safe form. This prevents overload and ensures accurate notifications.

For replacing poles marked in red: Create Dig Safe 1 for Poles 1, 1-1, and P2 all between Marquette St and Greenwood St; Dig Safe 2 for P3 between Greenwood St and Regan St; Dig Safe 3 for P4 and P5 both between Regan St and Nichols St. Group by street segments.

Is the Dig Site within 25ft from the Edge of the road or in the road? Yes/No. Installing Poles or Anchors? Yes/No. If yes, add multiple if described, #of Poles (<-3), Anchors. For this job, yes for pole/anchor installs.

Use Crew Hg code from STORMS. Add State, County, Municipality. County from GIS/STORMS. This Dig Safe is for NGrid pole/anchor replacements in make-ready for Comcast attachment WR 31213097 on Fern Hill Rd, Monson MA.

In National Grid's DigSafe process, you must complete a separate DigSafe form for each unique set of intersecting streets and for each pole that is not contiguous. A maximum of three poles can be included on one DigSafe form. For example, if replacing multiple poles, group them by street segments: DigSafe 1 for poles P1, P2 between Marquette St and Greenwood St; DigSafe 2 for P3 between Greenwood St and Regan St; DigSafe 3 for P4 and P5 between Regan St and Nichols St. Update the work request with the WO number and use crew Hg code from STORMS.

Dig Safes and NOEs are tied to digging work including pole replacements, anchor replacements, down ground rod replacements, push brace replacements. Example: pole replacements and replacing single down ground rod (reference standards 13-111B, 13-112, 13-113).

Group up to 3 contiguous/consecutive poles on one Dig Safe if they share the same set of cross streets. Non-contiguous poles or different cross streets require separate Dig Safes.

Use separate DigSafe tickets for poles with unique cross streets or locations even if close, good practice for accuracy, e.g., pole 25 between Fort and Parker, pole 26 between Fort and School.

MODULE: Module 5: Compliance and Notification Documentation
TITLE: Municipal Water/Sewer Notifications and Town-Specific Requirements
CONTENT_SUMMARY: Use NOE town by town water and sewer contact list 2021 from work order resources/ds_noe. For Monson (Bay State West tab), Dig Safe member for water and sewer: check NA for water notification, notes 'Dig Safe member'. If not Dig Safe member, e.g., Williamsburg: check fax NOE for water/sewer, notes 'fax to [contact] [fax number]' or call [contact] [phone]. Examples in table. Skip if no water/sewer.

Municipal Water Notification: DWA Call, Fax, Form, Digsafe, or Notes. Municipal Sewer Notification: Same options, often NA. Use for additional compliance.

Note Municipal Water Notification and Municipal Sewer Notification methods: Call, Fax, Form, Digsafe or NOE, with Notes. Maximum buffer distance options up to 1320'. Nearest House Address: 50.

For Municipal Water Notification and Sewer, reference NoE_Town by Town Water Sewer Contact List.xlsx found in Work Order Resources. Check N/A if town has no water, or note if Dig Safe Member. For Monson, MA, update notes accordingly. Each DigSafe form requires NOE documentation if applicable, using call, fax, or form as per town instructions.

In Module 5, the NOE Town by Town Water Sewer Contact List Excel file provides critical contact information for municipal water and sewer departments across regions like North and Granite, Bay State. Updated as of 09/24/21 by users like DRM, Hicks Alicia, it lists special instructions such as 'Water requires fax or call', contact names like Jeff Mason for Amesbury Water Department (978-388-0853), and methods like Dig Safe member status. For compliance, reference this list based on buffer distances from dig sites like 500' to 1320' to determine if Notice of Excavation is required.

The contact list flags Dig Safe members, e.g., Alstead NH Wells Septic, Boxford Wells & Septic with Alan Hill (603-304-9380), Chelmsford See Below for Water. Special notes include 'FAX George Daily' for Lawrence, 'DIG SAFE MEMBER send copy of digsafe ticket to amanda.patenaude@nationalgrid.com' for Monson. Non-Dig Safe towns like Everett require calling Engineering Dept (617-394-2250, NO FAX MUST CALL). Use Call, Fax, Form Digsafe or NOE checkboxes on capture forms.

Examples include Beverly: Contact BOTH local town and South Essex Sewer District; Billerica: Sewer Email Only, goullaq@town.billerica.ma.us; Dracut: See Below for Water (978-957-2073); Hamilton No Sewer, DPW David Hanlon (978-468-5591).

Always check 'Spec Inst' column.

For P10 Fern Hill Rd (42.157250,-72.336583), replace pole off South side ~300' East of 36 Fern Hill Rd house. Nearest House Address: 36 Fern Hill Rd. Determine NOE need via buffer from road center line: 500'-1320'. Means of Excavation: Pole Digger, Backhoe; No blasting/boring. Update capture form with Nature Description, check Municipal Water/Sewer Notification, notes like NA, Call, Fax Form Digsafe or NOE.

On Dig Safe capture forms, include side of road, pole #'s, identifiable distances. For water: If Dig Safe member, note 'Dig Safe Member'; No Water: 'No Water'. Check Call/Fax/NOE based on town prefs, add contacts/phone/fax/email in notes. For Monson: DIG SAFE MEMBER, send copy of ticket to amanda.patenaude@nationalgrid.com. Reference file in \syrfile15\projects\NationalGrid-...\DS NOE\ for compliance documentation.

When updating the Municipal Water Notification section in the Dig Safe Excel form, follow these rules: If the town has water and is a Dig Safe member, check N/A and add 'Dig Safe Member' to notes. If the town doesn't have water, check N/A and add 'No Water' to notes. If the town has water but is not a Dig Safe member, check the applicable checkboxes such as Call if they prefer phone contact, Fax Form or NOE if preferred, add the water department contact name, title, phone, fax, and email to notes as specified. Use the Nature Description section if more room is needed. Bay State West water requires NOE or call. Check the Town by Town Water & Sewer Contact List for specifics like contacts for Monson, Hardwick, Harvard, Lancaster, and others.

For the Municipal Sewer Notification section, apply similar rules as water: If the town has sewer and is a Dig Safe member, check N/A and add 'Dig Safe Member' to notes. If no sewer, check N/A and add 'No Sewer' to notes. If town has sewer but not Dig Safe member, check applicable checkboxes for Call, Fax Form, Digsafe or NOE, add sewer department contacts, phone, fax, emails to notes. No need to check checkboxes if not applicable. Include any pictures on documents tab. Use Nature/Description for extra room. Examples from list: Sheffield no sewer, Shirley contacts, etc.

In this module, begin by opening the 'NoE_Town by Town Water Sewer Contact List_09-22-21.xlsx' to identify specific requirements for each town. For example, Leicester requires calling Cherry Valley Rochdale Water

LESSON_ID: Preparing Notice of Excavation (NOE) Forms
MODULE: Module 5: Compliance and Notification Documentation
TITLE: Preparing Notice of Excavation (NOE) Forms
CONTENT_SUMMARY: NOE required if town has water/sewer and not Dig Safe member, one per Dig Safe form. Copy NOE template locally. Fill: City/Town/Dept (e.g., Monson Water/Sewer), Contact method/fax/phone from list (e.g., fax 123-456-7899), National Grid WO number, Excavation for facility: existing pole replacement (check box), Scope copy from Dig Safe, Address of excavation, Nearest intersection copy from Dig Safe, View of state/highway and street, Method of pre-mark painted, Sketch: snip GIS view with coords, north arrow, pole number pin, save PNG, insert/resize in form.

NOE required if town has water and/or sewer but ISN'T a Dig Safe member, or if they request call/fax/email. One NOE per Dig Safe form. For this chunk, Monson is Dig Safe but notes fax to Megan Gambrell 978-561-5612. Prepare NOE even for some members if specified. Update notes like 'Fax to Megan'.

Name file 'DigSafe_[WR#]_Poles'. City/Town: e.g., Monson. Department: Sewer/Water. Phone/Fax/Email from list (e.g., Faxto 413-455-7899 Megan). National Grid WR#: 31213097. Description: copy from Dig Safe, 'P10 Fern Hill Rd (42.157250,-72.336583) Replace pole...'. Check Existing Pole. Address: P10 Fern Hill Rd. Nearest house: 36 Fern Hill Rd. Cross streets: closest intersection. Method of Pre-mark: Painted for poles, Staked for anchors. Submit via fax/email as noted.

Notice of Excavations, or NOEs, are required when the town has water and/or sewer infrastructure and is not identified as a Dig Safe member. Additionally, if the town's requested contact method—such as fax or email—is noted in the Dig Safe form's MG Municipal Water and Sewer Notification section, you must prepare an NOE. Remember, one NOE is required for every Dig Safe form prepared.

Name the NOE file using the convention 'DigSafe_[WR #]'. If applicable, add the range of pole numbers to the end of the file name. For example, for Work Request 31213097, the file would be named DigSafe_31213097, with pole range if multiple poles are involved.

Check all applicable boxes for Excavation for facility: Existing Pole, New Pole (for setting a brand new pole), Anchor(s) (if replacing or installing), Ground Rod(s) (if replacing or installing), UG Conduit/Cable (if replacing or installing). Provide the Scope of National Grid Work and a brief description of the work. Use the Nature/Description section if more room is needed.

For ease, copy and paste the work address noted on the Dig Safe form into the Address of Excavation field. For Cross Streets, add the closest intersection(s), up to two, formatted as 'Intersection of Main St and Maple St'. Reference the Dig Safe form for accuracy.

For poles only, select 'Painted'. For anchors only, select 'Staked'. Note: NEINY means 'Not Entered In Yet'; check the appropriate box based on the work scope. Complex premarks should be updated as needed during precheck.

Check 'Painted' for poles and anchors. For anchors only in NE/NY, check 'Staked'. For poles and anchors, NE/NY check 'Staked Painted'. Ensure these are selected appropriately based on the work type like installing or replacing poles, anchors, or guys.

For NOE, if not DigSafe member (e.g., Shirley water/sewer), list departments, contact methods (fax/email, no phone), add rows for multiple contacts/numbers/emails. Copy work order, town, excavation details from DigSafe, scope (replace pole/down ground), closest intersection, painted pre-mark, max buffer 500 ft.

Zoom to relevant area, delete other poles, basemap view for cross streets, snip screenshot, edit in Paint: add north arrow, label pole (e.g., 25), save JPEG (pole25_noe.jpg), insert into NOE Excel sketch section, resize to fit.

Prepare Notice of Excavation forms in NoE_Form.xlsx capturing submission date, pre-mark date, design date, excavator details, National Grid WR#, Dig Safe #, scope (e.g., existing/new pole, anchor, ground rod, UG conduit/cable), address, cross streets, pre-mark method, and sketches. Include engineer comments and maximum dig distance from road centerline. Link to Dig Safe WR# 31215653 for Quincy Granite St project involving pole replacements and service transfers.

LESSON_ID: Customer Outage Lists: Criteria, Generation, and Examples
MODULE: Module 5: Compliance and Notification Documentation
TITLE: Customer Outage Lists: Criteria, Generation, and Examples
CONTENT_SUMMARY: Customer Outage List required for primary riser make ready (all res/com customers), secondary/service replacements requiring splicing (commercial only), transformer fuse link replacements (commercial only). Not for line cutout fuse links (use jumper). Drop trail on service/transformer/primary riser, NRID Electric > Directional Trace > Downstream. Export results to Excel, copy to local outage list Excel with headers, add pole/street/work (e.g., Pole 6 Fern Hill Rd replace service). Check res/com: service point > premises > specials > ESF data > RESOM field (R=residential, C=commercial). Commercial outage ~$1800 each.

Prepare for: All customers (primary riser make ready: risers/cutouts/fuselinks/splicing); Commercial only (secondary service replacements, splicing UG/primary/secondary, XFMR fuselink replacements, transformer replacements). Note: Line cutout fuse link no outage (jumper). Revised 7/15/24. Use CSS data in Service Point/Premise GIS for customers.

Prepare a Customer Outage List for all customers, both commercial and residential, in these situations: Primary Riser Make Ready, which includes replacement of risers, cutout bodies, fuselinks, and splicing in cable; Commercial Customer Secondary Service Replacements; Work Requiring Splicing of any UG, primary, or secondary cable; XFMR Related Fuselink Replacements; and Transformer replacements. Note that line cutout body fuse link replacement for 1ph or 3ph does not require outages, as crews can install a jumper to keep lines energized.

To determine if a customer is residential or commercial, check the CSS Data attribute 'res_com', which denotes residential (R) or commercial (C). Ignore customers without a res_com designation. Commercial customers usually require advanced notice of outages, and there are costs associated captured in NGRID's work order review process.

Use XFMR Customer Details when replacing XFMR protecting fuselink or service fed from XFMR. It's best for overview of impacted customers. Under Editor tab, select Specials and Customer Detail. In Customer Details window, choose period from same year as job. Export option available but lacks full addresses for outage list.

Directional Traces provide most detailed customer info including full addresses for outage list. Use for service replacements or UG primary splicing. Drop Trail Point on object, click NGRID Electric Directional Trace, check Down Stream, press play. Results at bottom; select customers, right-click Export to Excel. Excel opens on VDI drive.

For quick res_com check without export: Select Service Point in GIS, click premises to expand, double-click premise. Under Specials, click CSS Data, scroll to res_com attribute.

Review each page of construction sketches for outage items. Use above methods to extract customer info. Create local Excel file. Organize by pole with brief description of work requiring outage.

For pole work like P2-1 Benton Dr splice, list includes 180 Denslow Rd APT 1-8, STE 1-7: customers like COMM AP, DENSLOWELONGMEMA, Gambrell Megan, SHAWN SFE, DYLAN BC, AMY SANT, NOLAN C, GOLDENEE, RICHARD E. All active commercial, with phone numbers, mailing addresses like PO BOX.

P18 Industrial Dr splice: 105 INDUSTRIAL DR CANAMFIIE active industrial. P19: 119 INDUSTRI DR USPOSTA active commercial PO BOX 1270. P11: INDUSTRI DR MCGILL HCE active industrial PO BOX 408.

For B47 P10 Fern Hill Rd pole replace: Service Point 174734607, LC Number 50963978, house 36 FERN HILL RD, premise 274556800, electric load 1000, res_com via CSS, name PAUL SLATE, phone 6526350.

In the work order review process, analyze boundary information including town name like MONSON, primary distance, boundary type, one-phase and three-phase distances, boundary code, number of customers, SWIS code, and connected KVA by category (AB, MG, BC, AC, ABC, Unknown). Use boundary polygons, connected rice point, and premise GIS objects to identify customers needing outage notices.

For work requiring outages, such as transformer replacements, riser replacements, cutout bodies, fuselinks, or splicing (1ph/3ph, UG/OH primary/secondary), generate a customer outage list. Include details like premise number, house number, prefix, direction, street name, customer priority, primary service type (residential or commercial), and contact info. Capture associated costs during NGRID work order review.

Prepare Customer Outage Lists for all commercial and residential customers during Primary Riser Make Ready work, which includes riser replacements, cutout bodies, fuselinks, and cable splicing. Commercial customers only for Secondary Service Replacements. Required for all work involving splicing in UG, primary, or secondary cable, XFMR-related fuselink replacements, and transformer replacements.

LESSON_ID: Environmental Review Checklist: Purpose, Process, and Header Completion
MODULE: Module 5: Compliance and Notification Documentation
TITLE: Environmental Review Checklist: Purpose, Process, and Header Completion
CONTENT_SUMMARY: Environmental Checklist for digging work from resources/environmental/Checklist_MA. Name E&B Checklist-WO#. Fill: WO#, project name/application, location municipality, preparer/date, est start 6 months out (e.g., 5/14/2026). Scope: one pole replacement. Q1: MassMapper physical resources hydrography DEP wetlands, regulated areas FEMA flood polygons, within 100ft wetlands/floodplains or 200ft river/stream? No -> skip 1a-e. Q2: Conservation/recreation > natural heritage > rare species polygons within ? No. Q3: Contaminated areas GIS layer orange polygons. No. Q4: MACRIS map historic sites/districts polygons/points. No. Q5: Asbestos/lead/PCBs disturbed (risers/transformers). No. Q6 pole only: Shallow drinking wells GIS public data environmental shallow wells (add via GIS public data > shallow wells cfg > open dataset), within 50ft. No. Q7-8 no. No issues: 'No environmental concerns' at end. For multiple poles: CSV digs import Google My Maps vs MassMapper layers.

The Environmental Checklist identifies situations requiring NGRID's Environmental group for permitting before work. Answer questions to determine if an Environmental Review is needed; use the 'Poles with Digging Work' section for installation, removal, or replacement of poles, push braces, down guys, or ground rods. Note which pole in the comments if applicable. Find it at I:\projects|NationalGrid-Engineering|ProjectData|FieldData|Work Order Resources|Environmental, using the correct state version. Updated 12/28/23.

Fill Environmental Checklist for poles with Digging Work: install/remove/replace Poles, Anchors, Push Braces, Down Ground Rods. Questions on wetlands within 100', local bylaws (e.g., East Longmeadow Wetland Bylaw), shallow wells, stormwater. Use Notes/Comments for specifics. Location: \syrfile15\projects\NationalGrid-Engineering\ProjectData\FieldData\Work Order Resources\Environmental. If Yes, contact Environmental Rep, assign 468 in STORMS with form/site plans. Access GIS Public Data via NGRID menu > GIS Public Data. Tip: CSV digging poles to Google My Maps.

The Environmental Review Checklist is used as a way of identifying situations that may require the environmental group to obtain Environmental Permitting to perform the work. Based on the answers to the checklist questions, you need to request an Environmental Review. The checklist is specifically for poles with digging work, consisting of the installation, removal, or replacement of poles, anchors, push braces, down ground rods.

If any answers to the questions are checked 'Yes', contact the National Grid Environmental Representative for your territory for permitting assistance. For Electric Distribution Projects only, assign the 468 requirement in STORMS to the Environmental Representative with this completed form and appropriate site plans depicting the work. If no 'Yes' answers indicate need for assistance, the 255 requirement can be completed by the designer/engineer, and the project moves forward without further review or 468 requirement.

If the proposed work is customer-requested or generated outside National Grid, determine if a permit already exists covering utility work, such as highway projects or new subdivisions. If so, obtain a copy of the permit including drawings and site plans from the project owner like DOT or developers, and provide that documentation to the National Grid Environmental Representative.

It is imperative that this checklist be completed if the scope of work for a project is expanded or revised. Additionally, if filled out more than one year in advance of project initiation, it should be re-completed prior to project initiation due to the possibility of changed environmental conditions.

Fill out the top as follows: Project Name - Enter Application Name; W/O or W/R No. - Add Make Ready Work Order #; Associated W/O or W/R No.'s - Leave blank; Location - Enter City/Town Name; Estimated Start Date - Six months from the day you are filling out; Person Completing Checklist - Enter Work Order Writer's Name; Date - Enter the Date; Scope of Project - Count of poles with relevant digging work like pole replacements, anchor replacement, down ground replacements, pushbrace replacement.

To fill out the top of the Environmental Review Checklist, enter the Project Name as the Application Name, add the Make Ready Work Order number in the W/O or W/R No field, leave Associated W/O or W/R No blank, enter the City or Town Name in Location, set Estimated Start Date to six months from the date you are filling it out, put your name as the Person Completing Checklist, enter today's date, and describe the Scope of Project as the count of poles with relevant digging work such as pole replacements, anchor replacements without lead length change, down ground replacements, or pushbrace replacements.

Q1a: Check No. Q1b: Almost always 'No' unless work in wetland requires swamp mats. Q1c: Check 'No'. Q1d: Check 'No' unless extensive tree trimming required for poles with digging; often check 'Yes' if tree trimming needed. Q1e: Check 'Yes' if City/Town has local wetlands, stormwater, soil erosion bylaws - use Wetland and Stormwater By-laws Excel file in Environmental folder, Work Order Resources, search by City/Town.

For applications with multiple poles, review against the Environmental Checklist. Mark poles with digging work in CSV (add new column), in row with coordinates, import subset into Google Maps (My Maps if Gmail) to simplify review.

Example filled form: Project WNEN-JB2239999-GAP, WO 31213097, Location Monson MA, Estimated Start 5/14/26, Person Alicia Hicks, Date 11/14/25, Scope: One pole replacement. Notes on nearby wetlands within 100', Quaboag River, etc.

For Question 1, use the MassMapper Interactive Mapper from MassGIS at maps.massgis.digitalmass.gov/MassMapper/MassMapper.html. Under Physical Resources, select Hydrography Water Features and open each DEP Wetlands layer. Under Regulated Areas, select FEMA Flood Data and open each available layer. Check Yes for Q1 if there are any bodies of water, indications of wetlands or floodplains within 10 feet of digging work, or if a river or stream is located within 200 feet of the proposed digging work.

Subquestions 1a through 1e are only required if Q1 is Yes. For Q1a, check No. For Q1b, almost always check No unless work is in a wetland requiring swamp mats for job site access. For Q1c, check No. For Q1d, check No unless extensive tree trimming is required related to poles with digging work; tip: usually check Yes if any poles with digging also need tree trimming work.

For Q1e, check Yes if the City or Town is identified as having local wetlands, stormwater, and soil erosion bylaws. Use the Wetland and Stormwater By-laws Excel file found in the Environmental folder under Work Order Resources, and search by City/Town.

In the compliance documentation process, import Dig Safe CSV files into Google My Maps by selecting the file, choosing columns for positioning placemarks such as latitude and longitude, and selecting columns for titles like Work Order Number or Application Name. This visualizes utility work locations for review, as shown when handling files like DiGs.csv associated with work orders such as GATEWAY GW-GARDNER-28 and CNS-AERIAL-LOWELL-03.

Access MassGIS MassMapper at massgis.digital.mass.gov/MassMapper/MassMapper.html. Under Hydrography > Water Features, select DEP Wetlands layers and open each; under FEMA Flood Data, open available layers like Flood Zones from FIRMs. Zoom to work site to check for wetlands or floodplains within 100-200 feet of digging work, such as pole replacements, and mark 'Yes' on the checklist if present.

In MassMapper, navigate to Conservation Recreation > Natural Heritage Data. Right-click NHESP Priority Habitats of Rare Species and select Add Layer. Check if proposed poles fall within the polygon; answer 'Yes' on the environmental checklist if so, otherwise 'No'. This ensures compliance with rare species protections for utility projects.

In Smallworld GIS, use the Environmentally_Contaminated_Sites layer, visible by default, to identify contaminated sites near proposed digging locations. Cross-reference with the Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) Data Portal for site status. If digging sites are within, adjacent to, or near a contaminated polygon, note on the checklist and potentially contact environmental representatives.

Check if the city/town is identified as having local wetlands, stormwater, and soil erosion bylaws using the Wetland and Stormwater By-laws Excel file in the Environmental folder under Work Order Resources, searching by City/Town. Mark 'Yes' on the checklist if applicable, especially for poles with digging work; skip certain questions if work is within 10 feet of a paved roadway edge.

To determine if the city or town has local wetlands, stormwater, and soil erosion Community Preservation Act bylaws, check 'Yes' if identified. Use the Wetland and Stormwater By-laws Excel file found in the Environmental folder under Biolap Work Order Resources. Search by City or Town name to confirm.

For this question, use the MassMapper Interactive Mapper from MassGIS at https://maps.massgis.digital.mass.gov/MassMapper/MassM

LESSON_ID: Special Work Documentation: Police Protection, Rear Lot, Cutouts, and Critical Customers
MODULE: Module 5: Compliance and Notification Documentation
TITLE: Special Work Documentation: Police Protection, Rear Lot, Cutouts, and Critical Customers
CONTENT_SUMMARY: Material always AL with PE covering; neutral size/type OK or N/A. Services upgraded to #2 when replaced. Replace with PCOs if secondary raising >12'. Transferring secondary 5' on pole raises service 2.5' if mid-span. Replace if tap 3' from pole and net raise >1", especially #4 TPX. Multi-family up to 1/0. Consider replace if lowering 24". NY: transfer/splice, no replace. Non-tensioned spans sag considerably.

Check ownership before Make Ready: 'Customer' in attributes or account number indicates customer-owned. NGRID responsibility limited to bulb/photo-control. Refer to NE Company Owned St Light City-Town Listing July 2016.xls. Add notes to C-form description only, not sketches. Example: 'Town of Brockton to replace flex conduit and bond to neutral'. Applies to streetlights/floodlights.

Add 'Rear Lot Work' in bold to ES/C-form and construction sketch. May require police protection if conductors cross roadway.

Document in the work order if the work 'may require police protection if the work involves conductors.' This ensures compliance with safety regulations when handling live or de-energized conductors.

Effective immediately for primary work pole replacements where cutouts are involved: Transfer Newdovme polymer non-porcelain cutouts instead of replacing them. Replace only porcelain enclosed (banded/cutout porcelain), potted porcelain. Polymers that are OK to transfer meet or exceed IEC/ANSI specifications. Examples include certain aluminum, steel, and alloy cutouts shown. Incorporate this into designs and document transfers.

Effective immediately for primary work replacements involving cutouts, transfer new polymer non-ceramic cutouts rather than replacing them. Unlike porcelain enclosed banded torque tube potted porcelain cutouts which must be replaced, polymers are on the approved transfer list. Designers should incorporate this into new section designs, and crews should now transfer poly cutouts instead of replacing them as previously done.

Examples of cutouts approved for transfer include those meeting or exceeding IFCA specifications such as BtELE attachment IEC rated 5444-Alloy, Godot-Alloy, steel for head, guaranteed steel cutout load rated, and others listed by team members like Joshua Castellar, Megan Gambrell, Adam Mock, Alicia Hicks, and Ivan Washington.

Note that line cutout body fuse link replacements for 1-phase or 3-phase do not require outages. Crews can install a jumper to keep lines energized.

To determine if a customer is residential or commercial, use the CSS Data embedded within the Service Point or Premise GIS objects. Commercial customers require advanced outage notice and associated costs captured in NGRID's work order review process.

Work may require police protection if it involves conductors crossing the roadway. Rear lot work crossing roadway may need police detail.

Note that line cutout body fuse link replacement for 1ph or 3ph does not require an outage; crews can install a jumper to keep lines energized.

Rear Lot Work may require police protection if the work involves conductors crossing the roadway. Add 'Rear Lot Work' in bold to the ES/C-form and construction sketch.

For installing poles or anchors, determine if the dig site is within 25ft from the edge of the road or in the road (Yes/No). This is a compliance check shown in the interface.

Always add 'Rear Lot Work' in bold to the ES/C-form and construction sketch. Rear Lot Work may require police protection if the work involves conductors crossing a roadway. Reports and permits for this are none.

In the GIS software for NGRID, when planning compliance documentation for transformer installations, select the OH Transformer Installation feature. Key fields to document include Date Type such as S4B or S4D, Micro fields for winding configuration like Wye Wye, transformer enclosure flag like 40K, branch code, special use types, location leader, pole number like Amo 3-#2, transformer KV install work order from, WO annotation, remote WO annotation, quote units, standardized major code, and notes on outages where crews can install transformers during outages without fuselinks or splicing. Also note KVA rating like 75.00, voltage like 120/208V, phasing like single phase, and construction type. This data supports notification requirements and regulatory compliance.

To comply with notification protocols, use the GIS to determine which customers need notification based on load thresholds, indicated by phrases like 'ermine which customers need 82t' likely referring to 82kVA customers. Review associated customers such as Hicks, Alicia A, at locations like Quincy School St, Granite St, Fort St. Document commercial electric work, pole numbers, Suffolk review process, total KVA, and costs. This ensures notifications are sent to affected parties like those on Granite St (e.g., 166 Granite St) and Fort St (e.g., 98 Fort St).

For notification documentation, inspect secondary conductor properties in the GIS, including status li

Switch to 2019 Imagery or USGS layers for better visualization of potential floodplains or water bodies.

Activate the Measure Length/Area tool in the MassDEP Wetlands Map Viewer. Click points along the proposed work area boundary and nearby wetlands (e.g., WS1 at 200m, WS2, WS3) to calculate distances in feet or yards. For example, measure from 97 Maxwell Rd, Monson, MA coordinates (42°08'44.9"N 72°22'01.6"W) to wetland edges, recording totals like 248.82 ft or 515.27 ft to determine if within 100 feet threshold or 200 feet for streams.

In FORM 4 EG-30IMA Revision 19, answer Question 0: 'Are any bodies of water or indications of wetlands or floodplains located within 100 feet of the proposed work, or is river or stream located within 200 feet?' Use Flood Insurance Maps (enter address in upper left text box) and MADEP Wetlands viewer. If Yes, proceed to 1.a (utility emergency?), 1.b (construction mats?), 1.c (dewatering?), 1.d (vegetation management?), 1.e (local bylaws via NE Municipal Natural Resource Permitting Restriction Database). Note to re-complete if scope changes or over 1 year old.

For checklist question on Natural Heritage Area or Rare/Endangered Species Habitat, access NHESP Priority Habitat of Rare Species via MassGIS ArcGIS Map Viewer (layers-a953ef7fe0744ef2b2a8fb49118c51c7). Search and zoom to project address like 97 Maxwell Rd, Monson. Attempt to add 'NHESP Priority Habitats' layer under Conservation Recreation > Natural Heritage Data. Note errors if layer fails to load; inspect for overlapping habitats near Palmer Reservoir or surrounding areas.

Answer checklist: 'Is proposed work area within/adjacent to contaminated oil/hazardous materials area?' Per customer, owner, or National Grid GIS. In GIS (WynchdrsOllgis_public_data), add Environmental Contamination_Sites folder/config file, search address for colored polygons. Cross-check MADEP Waste Site Reportable Releases Look Up. If Yes, notify Environmental Rep for soil disposal, decontamination, oversight.

For installation of treated wood poles, check: 'Within 50 feet of known shallow drinking water well (<10 ft water level)?' Use GIS (WynchdrsOllgis_public_data > Environmental Shallow Wells folder/config), search address for multi-ring buffers (50/100 ft). Note data limitations (public only). Check bylaws for pole restrictions. Relocate poles or use alternatives if within 50 ft; contact Env Rep. For IMAP users, layer always visible.

To check if the proposed work area is located within or adjacent to an area contaminated with oil or hazardous materials, open the GIS map system and navigate to public_data. Open the Environmental_Contamination_Sites folder, load the configuration file, and search for the address of interest. Colored polygons will indicate potential areas of concern.

CONTENT_SUMMARY: Copy FAA spreadsheet, rename with WR. Enter designer, WO number, project desc from Helix (3rd party). Street Maxwell Rd, pole 33-4, existing/new sizes 35/3 class 4? Use Google Earth measure to airports >10k ft no need. Criteria: >20k ft long runway slope 100:1, shorter 50:1. Sheltered if buildings taller. Here NA, not exceed notice criteria, NRID Verizon ELCO set.

Brendan uses Google Earth Pro to locate 33-4 Maxwell Rd, Monson MA (approx 42.14503N 72.36741W), draws polygon/line paths measuring distances to nearby airports: Westover Metropolitan Airport (~5 mi), Bradley International (~25 mi), Northampton Airport, etc. Measurements like Map Length 807.71 ft, Ground Length 808.33 ft initially, scaling to 3-48k ft to assess if pole height (35/3 ~45ft) triggers FAA Form 7460-1 notice under 14 CFR Part 77 slopes (100:1 beyond 20k ft runway >3200ft, etc.).

In FAA Spreadsheet (Dist_Design TAB), Brendan adds entry for WR 31211166, Feeder 514L1 MA, Project COMCAST WNEN-JB2240030-GAP (3rd party), Street Maxwell Rd Monson MA, Pole #33-4, Existing Pole Size 30/4, New Pole Size 35/3, Existing Anchor Size blank, New Anchor Size blank. This tracks potential FAA obstruction evaluation needs based on height changes near airports.

Brendan reviews 'FAA memo draft2' document outlining 14 CFR Part 77 and FAA Order JO 7400.2L criteria for when Notice of Proposed Construction (Form 7460-1) is required: >200ft AGL; within 20k ft of runway >3200ft exceeding 100:1 slope; 10k ft runway <=3200ft at 50:1; 0.5k ft heliport at 25:1. Exemptions for shielded structures in congested areas. Temporary cranes covered if <= final height. Submit 45 days prior via oeaaa.faa.gov. Use Google Maps for runway lengths.

Federal Aviation Regulations under 14 CFR Part 77 require notice to the FAA for construction or alteration of certain structures to assess potential hazards to air navigation. Notice must be filed at least 45 days before construction starts or building permit application, whichever is earliest. The purpose is to evaluate hazards based on structure height and proximity to airports or heliports. Use FAA Order JO 7400.2L Section 77.1 for criteria.

Notice is required if the structure is taller than 200 feet above ground level regardless of location; or within 20,000 feet of a public or military airport with runway longer than 3,200 feet and height exceeds 100:1 slope (100 horizontal to 1 vertical) from closest airport point; or within 10,000 feet of runway 3,200 feet or less with 50:1 slope; or within 2,000 feet? of public heliport with 25:1 slope. For example, 7,000 feet from airport with 3,200+ ft runway requires notice only if 70 feet or taller.

Apply slope criteria practically: farther from airport means taller structure needed to trigger notice. Most distribution poles are about 45 feet tall, so many near-airport projects don't require notice. Calculate slope from closest point of airport property: e.g., 100 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical for precision runways over 3,200 feet.

Certain structures are exempt per Section 77.9(e): those in congested areas, cities, towns, or settlements; or shielded by existing permanent structures, natural terrain, or topographic features of equal or greater height. Apply common sense in population centers; regulation doesn't strictly define terms but considers shielding if proposed structure is same height or shorter than shielding feature.

FAA has jurisdiction over temporary construction equipment like cranes and derricks used briefly on site. If FAA approves the proposed structure, approval letter covers temporary equipment not exceeding proposed height. Order JO 7400.2L governs this; exceeds require separate consideration.

Submit notice electronically via FAA Form 7460-1 on the FAA website at https://oeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/externalportal/splash. Also required for some airport/heliport property projects or roads/railroads, but typically not for utility poles. Estimate runway lengths using Google Maps.

In this Comcast WNEN-JB2240030-GAP project at Maxwell Rd, Monson MA, replacing pole 33-4 from 30/40 to 35/3 (approx 45 ft), determination is 'Does not exceed notice criteria'. Eye altitude 50,752 ft, but height doesn't trigger Part 77 slopes or thresholds near airports.

In Helix ALM NGrid Application Tracking (#311740671), Brendan views workflow for COMCAST WNEN-JB2240030-GAP (WR 31211166), notes assignments (to Alarie Brendan), status (Work Order Being Written), applicant (Comcast), town (Monson), street (Maxwell Rd), and joint pole details.

From STORMS, access linked Helix ALM NGrid Application Tracking for Application #31174067. View details like applicant Comcast, status 'Work Order Being Written assigned Alarie Brendan', entered 6/26/2025, joint pole app AMAO300561150, target completion August 10, 2025, and workflow events like reassigns.

In Helix Application Tracking filtered by 'Assigned to Brendan', Brendan reviews his queue including COMCAST WNEN-JB2240030-GAP (WR 31211166), noting reassignments from Torrez Teddy and targets like 8/10.

Access process documents under Work Order Resources > Process Documents, such as 'Create WR in NE (shortcut to WO 10.0.docx)' and 'NGrid_Make_Ready_Work_Order_Process_10-10-25.docx'. These guide creating DISTTPTYA or YAMO from SAD Work Request for New England, distinguishing capital vs maintenance pole replacements.

On the SAD Work Request (job type: SAD Work Request, status: NonAssigned), verify Requirements tab: Complete 226R (Field Survey) by adding if missing, and 254R (Reconcile Application with Telco) set to Complete post-telco agreement. This prepares for copying to DISTTPTYA.

In Associated Parties tab of SAD WR, right-click > Add: Entity ID 'TP', Notes with name, Description 'Osmos', Proposal Number '600', Phone, and Name field with period (.) to avoid errors. This notifies National Grid of MSA info.

Edit > Copy Work Order from SAD WR: Update Required By/Scheduled Date to 6 months ahead (e.g., 05/19/2026), copy Comments, Associated Parties, Geographical, Documents, Remarks. Change Work Order Type to 'Designed', Job Type to 'DISTTPTYA'. Cross-reference WO numbers in Extra Info and TPMR Remarks.

In Financials tab of new DISTTPTYA WR, paste Funding Project Number from Helix (e.g., for Gateway in Lennox, MA) into Installation/Removal/Transfer before hitting 'Get Work Order' to lock financials. Auto-completes 250R. Caution: Irreversible after Get WO.

For 252R (payment for survey/design): If Complete on SAD WR, complete on DISTTPTYA. If Required/Partial on SAD, assign to 3RDPTY_NE_AMELINK on DISTTPTYA. Add 253R/283R manually (complete, assign self), bypass 267R (attachments post-construction).

This process document is used specifically to create PTYA WR# or YAMO WR# by copying from an existing SAD WR# in the STORMS system for New England work orders. Note that SAD WR#s are only used in New England. Importantly, this process is not for sub work; for sub work PTYA WR, do not copy from D12RH or DIZRH, instead use TRANSPTYA to make a new work order.

On the SAD WR, the 012T8 NGrid_Capital_Vers 226R requirement should be marked as Completed when you start your design. This indicates that the field survey has been completed, you are working on the design, and prevents it from still showing as Required in STORMS.

The 254R requirement should be set to Partial when sending an application to TELCO, and then set to Complete once an agreement is reached with TELCO.

The 0121T NGrid_CUsAA-Lite requirement should be marked as Complete in STORMS.
